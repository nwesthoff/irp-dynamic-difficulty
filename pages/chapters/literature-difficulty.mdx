## Puzzle Difficulty

By now it should be obvious that designing extremely hard puzzles shouldn't be the primary goal. However, when we do want to increase or decrease difficulty to cater to different players, there are several (metaphorical) dials to turn. In _Designing the Puzzle_, Bob Bates argues that's one of the easiest parts of puzzle design <Citation id="bates_1997_designing" />.

1. **Breadcrumbs —** Change the amount or directness of information to players
2. **Alternate solutions —** Adding alternate solutions make a puzzle easier
3. **Steps to solve —** Increasing the steps to solve a puzzle increases the difficulty
4. **Proximity —** The closer (physiologically and geographically) the solution, the easier
5. **Steering the Player —** nudging in the right direction, as a response to player actions

It's also important to be aware of some traps. Elumir thinks many escape rooms make the same errors when they try to increase difficulty <Citation id="elumir_2019b_how" hideAuthor />. He describes five:

1. Identifying gates and collecting clues should be straightforward
2. It should be obvious which puzzles to work on
3. Revelatory puzzles are hard to do well, adding too many shuts out mainstream players
4. Don't add tedium to slow players down, ex. unscrewing lots of screws instead of few
5. Don't make it difficult to enter a combination

## Flow

Flow is a well established concept, as introduced by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi <Citation id="" />. Flow is defined as an optimal experience; a challenging activity that requires skill. Activities that put us in a state of flow are goal-directed and bounded by rules. When this state is reached, it completely consumes what we're doing and makes time pass without us noticing. Game designers try to achieve this state of being by carefully crafting the games' flow. Creating an almost rhythmic movement moving from emotional high to low points, and vice-versa.

## Dynamically Adjusting Game Flow

These are some hypothetical scenarios of groups reaping the benefits of a dynamically controlled escape room.

### Enthusiasts looking for a challenge

The main complaint from enthusiasts at The Vault is a lack of challenge. Puzzles are (sometimes) a-logical, and merely an action to do. The experience of the room makes up for it, but Sherlocked wants to offer a bigger challenge to their (most loyal) customers.

### Enthusiasts having a bad day

What if a second group of enthusiasts play the new experience. They start of well but quickly realise they've taken on too much. They might get knocked down from the highest difficulty, all the way down to an easy level. This way even they get to see the finish line, though that does not ensure they escape.

### Team of colleagues, novice escape room players

On the other hand we might see a group of colleagues that know each other well, but have never played an escape room together. They might start of quite anxious, but also are deeply curious and driven to do well. They soon realize they're on a roll and might even think the puzzles start to become boring. The DDA kicks things up a notch and grows with them, they play their final puzzle(s) at the highest level.

## Beyond Difficulty

### Four Keys to Fun

Lazarro <Citation id="lazarro_2004_why" hideAuthor /> has studied players' emotions before, during and after play. Through facial gestures, body language and verbal comments they identified four keys to create emotion without story cutscenes.

1. **Hard Fun** — The enjoyment of challenge and progress
2. **Easy Fun** — The enjoyment of being immersed in a game
3. **Altered States** — The enjoyment of changes in internal state
4. **People Factor** — The enjoyment of playing with others

Interestingly, the 2004 study doesn't describe any reactive system. I expect this is due to its age, and Lazarro seems to have aimed her sights on it more recently.

In her talk _Four Keys to Fun: Using Emotions to Create Engaging Design_ at AIGA Design <Citation id="lazarro_2016_games" hideAuthor />, she describes how game design and human centered design relate. She explains how we as designers can react to people's emotions.

> These systems identify... they might be able to read your emotions that you're feeling and make adjustments according to that. Or you might as the user choose an emotion. I need to feel more creative, so these are the emotions I feel.
