## Measuring the Player's Gameplay Experience

To understand what experience players desire, and how we should tailor the experience to them, we have to understand how they feel during play. There have been several attempts at measuring players' gameplay experience, while playing.

## Physiological measurement

Another of such attempts is done by Nacke & Lindley <Citation id="nacke_2008_flow" hideAuthor />, who measure the emotional state of their test subjects, while playing modified levels of Half-Life 2 (a first-person shooter). They grade the experience on two axes.

- Electromyography (EMG) to determine valence, a strong indicator of the _good_-ness of an experience.
- Galvanic Skin Response (GVR) commonly used as an indicator for arousal (how passionate we are about an experience)

Their study suggests that game levels scoring high on flow, show increased values for valence as well as arousal. Established companies, like Garmin, claim to measure stress in several of their products, based on HRV (Heart Rate Variation).

Their manual <Citation id="" /> classifies stress states ranging from 0 to 100, where:

- **0 to 25:** is a resting state
- **26 to 50:** is low stress
- **51 to 75:** is medium stress
- **76 to 100:** is high stress

Empatica offers the CE-certified E4, and lists the _EmbracePlus_ as a scientific tool. They offer real-time access to EDA, PPG, HR(V), IBI and movement through their SDK.

FitBit offers several API's to achieve similar goals, but as wel'll learn, these claims aren't as reliable as they sound.

### What is Emotion?

To understand how people feel it's key to know how emotion works. Unfortunately, the scientific community has not seen eye-to-eye in this regard. Generally speaking there are three major lines of thinking; Basic Emotional Theory, Appraisal Theory and the Theory of Constructed Emotion. The last one of those, a fairly recent development, flips our common line of thinking about emotion on its head.

### Variability

If Lisa Feldman Barrett is to be believed, both _physiological changes_ in our bodies and _facial expressions_ aren't a reliable way to estimate how people feel. Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett explains how emotions are not caused by physiological changes in our body. Emotions are in fact a result of the physiological changes in our body, and how our brains makes them _feel_ important to us <Citation id="" hideAuthor />.

> Your emotions are not your reactions to the world. They are your constructions or more precisely, what your bodily sensations mean in a specific context or situation that you are in.
>
> - Lisa Feldman Barrett <Citation id="" hideAuthor />

It turns out that the western idea of universal expressions of emotion are not so universal after all. While some people certainly scowl when they are angry, not everyone does. At the same time, many people who scowl are not angry.

> People move their face in very different ways during instances of the same emotion category. They also move their faces in exactly the same way in instances of different emotion categories.
>
> - Lisa Feldman Barrett <Citation id="" hideAuthor />

Assuming we display emotion using universal facial expressions suffers from the same problems as assuming everyone entering an escape room has the same level of experience. This way of thinking only takes into account a small portion of people.

To make matters worse, physiological measurements suffer from a similar problem. When an increased heart rate feels like anxiety, that is because your brains categorises it as such. They make a concept that fits with the physiological changes in your body. As a result, it's incredibly hard to 'measure emotion'. Emotions are dependant of context, and part of that context is the body we take into the room.

# Team

## Team Performance

All of this might be explained by the definition of experience. As I've argued before, experiences are not self-contained. They occur in a larger context and are highly personal. They are influenced not only by what we feel, see or hear at that time, but also the memories we take into an escape room <Citation id="" />. Since escape rooms are (generally) multi-user experiences, it's impossible to adjust the experience to fit every individual in the room. Regardless of whether we're able to sense how each individual feels. As such, it makes sense to look at the team playing a game as a whole. How do they communicate? What do they talk about, and what _don't_ they talk about?

Marlow et al. <Citation id="" hideAuthor /> conducted a meta-analysis of team communication. They argue that teams that are more familiar with each-other, communicate less frequently, but communication quality increased. Familiar teams share information that is less redundant, and as such communication efficiency increases. Furthermore, they determined good communication is more important to familiar teams than non-familiar teams.
