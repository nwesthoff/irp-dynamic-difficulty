# Team

## Team Performance

All of this might be explained by the definition of experience. As I've argued before, experiences are not self-contained. They occur in a larger context and are highly personal. They are influenced not only by what we feel, see or hear at that time, but also the memories we take into an escape room <Citation id="" />. Since escape rooms are (generally) multi-user experiences, it's impossible to adjust the experience to fit every individual in the room. Regardless of whether we're able to sense how each individual feels. As such, it makes sense to look at the team playing a game as a whole. How do they communicate? What do they talk about, and what _don't_ they talk about?

Marlow et al. <Citation id="" hideAuthor /> conducted a meta-analysis of team communication. They argue that teams that are more familiar with each-other, communicate less frequently, but communication quality increased. Familiar teams share information that is less redundant, and as such communication efficiency increases. Furthermore, they determined good communication is more important to familiar teams than non-familiar teams.

## Team Communication

- Group Flow

Better teams communicate better (?), increasing the necessity for communication in the 'more difficult' track might be a good build?

# Dynamically Adjusting Game Flow

These are some hypothetical scenarios of groups reaping the benefits of a dynamically controlled escape room.

### Enthusiasts looking for a challenge

The main complaint from enthusiasts at The Vault is a lack of challenge. Puzzles are (sometimes) a-logical, and merely an action to do. The experience of the room makes up for it, but Sherlocked wants to offer a bigger challenge to their (most loyal) customers.

### Enthusiasts having a bad day

What if a second group of enthusiasts play the new experience. They start of well but quickly realise they've taken on too much. They might get knocked down from the highest difficulty, all the way down to an easy level. This way even they get to see the finish line, though that does not ensure they escape.

### Team of colleagues, novice escape room players

On the other hand we might see a group of colleagues that know each other well, but have never played an escape room together. They might start of quite anxious, but also are deeply curious and driven to do well. They soon realize they're on a roll and might even think the puzzles start to become boring. The DDA kicks things up a notch and grows with them, they play their final puzzle(s) at the highest level.
