# The State of Escape Rooms

## Elements of an Escape Room

What draws people to escape rooms differs from group to group, and from person to person. Fortunately, there has been extensive — though mostly unscientific — research on that. The _Escape Room Enthusiast Survey_, a yearly reoccurring survey by and for enthusiasts goes in deep. It ranks the importance of several elements within escape rooms. In 2019 <Citation id="elumir_2019a_2019" />, the three factors considered most essential by enthusiasts are:

1. Well designed puzzles and game flow
2. Novelty & Uniqueness
3. Immersion

This isn't a comprehensive list of _everything_ an escape room has to do well. It does however provide us with a handhold to discuss the most important topics. We'll dig deep into each of these factors in this chapter.

### Puzzle flow

In reality, even these three models do not show a complete picture. Escape rooms often combine some or all of these approaches in an experience. In reality, designers might gradually expose more and more rooms within the room. Or they might choose to direct players to work together, so they don't miss the most important story points of the experience.

Sherlocked's upcoming experience illustrates this reality very well. Throughout the experience players have one end-goal, to perform a ritual. The figure below shows a stylised representation of the (preliminary) game flow. Their access to rooms (yellow boxes) is gradually rolled out, but many-a-times players will work on multiple puzzles at the same time.

Another great example is Dark Park's _The End_, which I played with my colleagues at Sherlocked (and cannot recommend enough). Their game is mostly linear, leading from one room to the next. It hosts a room that is about traversal, getting from one place to another. Another, is more puzzle-y in nature. A few puzzles are available at the same time. This allows teams to divide the work, and all of them have to be finished to 'solve' that room.

Designers combine the previously defined approaches to balance out the pros and cons of each. Sometimes they might chose to the experience of the individual over the team, and vice-versa. In other instances they might choose favour the progression of difficulty over the freedom of the players.

## Puzzle Difficulty

According to Victor _Designing the Puzzle_ is _the_ piece to read on <Citation id="bates_1997_designing" />.

It's important to be aware of some traps. Elumir thinks many escape rooms make the same errors when they try to increase difficulty <Citation id="elumir_2019b_how" hideAuthor />. He describes five things to look out for when designing for difficulty:

1. Identifying gates and collecting clues should be straightforward
2. It should be obvious which puzzles to work on
3. Revelatory puzzles (aha) are hard to do well, adding too many excludes mainstream players
4. Don't add tedium to slow players down, ex. unscrewing lots of screws instead of few
5. Don't make it difficult to enter a combination

### Moderating difficulty

Theory has shown the importance of game flow, as discussed previously. Linear, story driven (video) games actively control how the player should feel during certain scenes.

These three examples show the variety (video) game designers have played with previously. Carefully moderating challenge is essential to a good gameplay experience. Too much tension, and we wear out. Too much relaxation, and we grow bored. When the conditions previously described are met, experience seamlessly unfolds from moment to moment.

If the escape room enthusiast survey is anything to go by, proper challenge is extremely important to escape rooms. As a metric in itself, but as a dependency for immersion as well. Offering a cognitively demanding, though achievable, experience seems to be a major key to success in games and escape rooms alike.

## Conflicts of immersion

Escape rooms as a medium do well in some parts of immersion, but have much to improve in other areas. Some of these conflicts of interest have been resolved partially resolved though.

There have certainly been attempts to bring them closer together. At Sherlocked they use several techniques to blur the lines between reality and fiction. From working with them I've noticed their narrative design is heavily inspired by real historical characters.

I have noticed a few approaches:

- Blurring where 'the experience' starts
- Make the solution to the puzzle depend on the story
- Use 'real' places and people to base the story off

### The experience has already started

Sherlocked's _The Vault_ is praised for another quality. They never tell you when the experience has started. You'll get some cryptic text messages, and slowly but surely you're rolling into an immersive adventure.

### Know the story to solve the puzzle

Victor has an interesting approach to draw even the most puzzle-savvy players into the narrative.

> The trick is to make it clear from the start that you can’t achieve the one without the other. That in order to complete the game, you need to understand the story.

> - Victor van Doorn

For Sherlocked, one of their primary goals designing new experiences is to have you guessing whether what just happened is real. At least for some people they seem to have succeeded. Victor told me he has hosted a group of players from Saudi Arabia that didn't want to continue, because they thought they were doing a real heist.

# What Enthusiasts look for

## Designing extreme difficulty

Jesse Schell notes there is much debate about the difficulty of games. Whether it is a bad thing or a good thing to allow players to reach a level where they spend so much time in the frustration zone that they give up on the game. Some video games...

## Speaking with enthusiasts

- Enthusiast 1: Tends to shy away from an export mode. It often feels like 'difficulty through omission', guessing what the designer had in mind.
- Enthusiast 2: Don't mind hints, I would much rather escape with help than without. However, this player didn't like systems that automatically give clues.

  > Automated hint systems, those make my [redacted] go limp.

- Enthusiast 3: Was very interested in the tech behind it. Often enjoys a behind-the-scenes that goes deep. Would like a way to reflect on his performance.

  > This is something I want; the ability to reflect on our team performance. To determine where we miscommunicated.

# Dynamic game design

## Examples of dynamic difficulty

Now, dynamic difficulty isn't exactly a new idea. There are several examples of dynamic difficulty to be found, across several mediums. In the video gaming industry there are the obvious solutions like match-making (opponents are matched on experience level), but less obvious ones as well. I've also spoken to several escape game designers and hosts. To reveal some of the mysteries of dynamic game design in its current state, which we'll discuss in this section.

### Video games

- Metal Gear Solid 5
  - if you die often you get the option to wear a chicken hat
  - enemies respond to repetitive tactics
- Resident Evil 4
  - very opaque dynamic difficulty
- Uncharted 4
  - The first puzzle is always the easiest, regardless of which location is visited first

### Portable 'escape rooms'

- David Middleton (Bewilder Box)

### Escape Rooms

- Jesse van der Lely (Lab13/Live Escape)
- Niels Jonker (Escapist)

- Diagram of Marlow's theory (ex):
  - A: groepen kennen elkaar niet. Communicatie frequentie is lager(?) en niet efficient, dus groep presteert slecht
  - B: Groepen kennen elkaar een beetje: communicatie frequentie is hoog en niet efficient, groep presteert medium
  - C: groepen kennen elkaar goed: communicatie frequentie is laag maar efficient, groep presteert goed

# Conclusions / Key Insights

- We determine puzzle difficulty by duration, might this be the wrong metric?

Now, these points might seem obvious, especially to avid escape room designers. But it took a while before they really sank in for me. Escape rooms are special in three ways:

**They occur in a physical space.**
Result? Sensory immersion comes easy because:

- Result of _multi-channel information_
- _Completeness_ of information

**They are a group experience.**
The experience has to work for _multiple people_ at the same time.
The experience has to work for varying group sizes.

**There is a time constraint.**
We promise an experience of _x minutes_. We better deliver.
