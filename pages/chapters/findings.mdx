title: "State of Escape Rooms"
subtitle: "Findings"
introduction: "Beyond what the literature says, there is a plethora of knowledge in the practice of escape room design, that's uncommon in theoretical analyses. Since escape room design is such a young industry, there are relatively few established rules. And the ones that do exist get experimented with or broken entirely, sometimes leading to a better experience. In this chapter, we'll learn how the real world differs from what the literature says."

# What makes or breaks an escape room experience?

Previously, we established a theoretical understanding of the inner workings of escape rooms. In practice a lot of nuancing needs to be done to fully understand what makes them tick.

### Puzzle flow in practice

The three models of puzzle flow Heikkinen & Shumeyko <Citation id="heikkinen-and-shumeyko_2016_designing" hideAuthor /> describe, do not portray a complete picture of reality. Real-world escape rooms often combine some or all of these approaches to complete an experience.

In reality, designers might gradually expose more and more rooms within the room. Or they might choose to direct players to work together, so they don't miss the most important story points of the experience.

Sherlocked's upcoming escape game illustrates this reality very well. Throughout the experience players have one end-goal, to perform an occult ritual. The figure below shows a stylised representation of the (preliminary) puzzle flowchart through time. Their access to rooms (yellow boxes) is gradually rolled out. However, players are often asked to backtrack and the team is directed to work on multiple puzzles at the same time.

Another great example is Dark Park's _The End_, which I played with my colleagues at Sherlocked (and cannot recommend enough). Their game is mostly linear, leading from one room to the next. It hosts a room that is about traversal, getting from one place to another. Another, is more puzzle-y in nature. A few puzzles are available at the same time. This allows teams to divide the work, and all of them have to be finished to 'solve' that room.

Designers combine the previously defined approaches to balance out the pros and cons of each. Sometimes they might chose to the experience of the individual over the team, and vice-versa. In other instances they might choose favour the progression of difficulty over the freedom of the players.

### Linearity gaining traction

As part of the panel I hosted, Nick Moran spoke about escape games moving increasingly to linear experience. Rather than having a task or puzzle for every player at any time.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/nick-moran-linear-trend.mp3" />

> It's not how I thought games should be designed or like probably would have done designs, but it's what players seem to want. [...] The most praised games tend to be incredibly linear. So that's what, you know, you got to follow a little what other people want.
>
> - Nick Moran <Citation id="moran_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

## Puzzle Difficulty

Moran says linearity doesn't mean easier per se. But it does indicate a new found focus on story. It favours experiencing the narrative as a group, to connect with the emotional beats and keep the experience consistent across the group.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/nick-moran-three-types-challenge.mp3" />

> To talk about fairness. Um, so I think there are three sides to difficulty. Which is **physical difficulty**, **intellectual difficulty**, and the **difficulty of the unfamiliar**. And I think you can only have, I only ever have a puzzle that tests people in one of three of these areas. And that's what for me, what I think helps construct a fair puzzle... in the context of a live experience.
>
> - Nick Moran <Citation id="moran_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

### Puzzle testing

- Escape rooms run routinely, and game hosts watch in on every game played.
- In that sense, escape rooms test almost like a restaurant improves its menu, constantly receiving passive and active feedback

### Doing difficulty wrong

It's important to be aware of some traps. Elumir thinks many escape rooms make the same errors when they try to increase difficulty <Citation id="elumir_2019b_how" hideAuthor />. He describes five things to consider when designing difficulty:

1. Identifying gates and collecting clues should be straightforward
2. It should be obvious which puzzles to work on
3. Revelatory puzzles (aha) are hard to do well, adding too many excludes mainstream players
4. Don't add tedium to slow players down, ex. unscrewing lots of screws instead of few
5. Don't make it difficult to enter a combination

### Moderating game flow

Theory has shown the importance of game flow, as discussed previously. Linear, story driven (video) games actively control how the player should feel during certain scenes.

These three examples show the variety (video) game designers have played with to craft a well-rounded experience. Carefully moderating challenge is essential to a good gameplay experience. Too much tension, and we wear out. Too much relaxation, and we grow bored. When the conditions previously described are met, experience seamlessly unfolds from moment to moment.

Escape room designers use different approaches to solve the same issue. Tommy Honton mentions escape rooms often surprise players to have them disconnect from their previous challenge. They pace out moments to make players realise what an action just did to the world they interact with.

> Each room that opens up, you have a moment of disconnecting what opened up, and taking in that new data.
>
> - Tommy Honton <Citation id="constructed_2020_interview" hideAuthor />

If the escape room enthusiast survey is anything to go by, proper challenge is extremely important to escape rooms. As a metric in itself, but it's important as a prerequisite for immersion as well. Offering a cognitively demanding, though achievable, experience seems to be a major key to success in games and escape rooms alike.

## Conflicts of immersion

Escape rooms as a medium do well in some parts of immersion, but have much to improve in other areas. As Haley Cooper <Citation id="cooper_2018_immersive" hideAuthor /> notes, the nature of escape rooms hinders the narrative immersion some other mediums do offer because spaces don't feel real. Furthermore, agency takes away control of pacing.

Some of these conflicts of interest have been partially resolved though. There have certainly been attempts to make the three work better together. At Sherlocked they use several techniques to blur the lines between reality and fiction. These exist elsewhere in the industry, but they are certainly not employed in every experience.

### Blurring when the experience starts

One of the things Sherlocked's _The Vault_ is praised for is its ability to conceal when the experience has started. You'll get some cryptic text messages, and slowly but surely you're rolling into an immersive adventure. There is no host to receive you as the host of Sherlocked. Instead, you'll have to word-wrestle your way into a high-class art gallery. Leaving your coats and phone all happens in-story. You never stop to think 'oh _now_ we're _really_ getting started'. The gradual introduction to the story has you questioning afterwards when the experience actually did start. That is something Victor thinks Sherlocked does best.

### Make the solution to the puzzle depend on the story

Another area to focus on is using puzzles as a touchpoint for the narrative. A winning technique is to make the challenge and story co-depend on each other. In order to progress through the escape room, players _have_ to know the story. Victor, notes that it's important to make this clear from the start. To set a precedent for late-game puzzles. Victor uses this as a hook to draw even the most puzzle-savvy players into the narrative.

> The trick is to make it clear from the start that you can’t achieve the one without the other. That in order to complete the game, you need to understand the story.
>
> - Victor van Doorn

For Sherlocked, one of their primary goals designing new experiences is to have you guessing whether what just happened is real. An excellent anecdote of them succeeding at that promise is the story Victor told me of a game he once hosted. He told me about a group of players from Saudi Arabia that didn't want to continue _The Vault._ They genuinely believed to be participating in an actual heist. While not every player responds as strongly, at least some people have been second-guessing.

### Use of historical figures and places

The last point Sherlocked seems to excel is that their narrative design is heavily inspired by real historical characters. Borrowing names, like Tesla and Newton to instantly connect the narrative with the real world. They employ historical figures as a basis for the narrative. In a similar vein, they use real places. Their sets are constructed within the confines of a monumental building. _The Vault_, for example, is built within the vault room at _Beurs van Berlage,_ which instantly grants their story some credibility. Their experiences borrow characteristics from docudrama feature films (eg. Bohemian Rhapsody) along with science fiction (eg. Star Wars). Thus ultimately falling somewhere in between.

# How does the experience of enthusiasts differ from other players?

Fortunately, there has been extensive — though mostly unscientific — market research on player preferences. We can quickly retrieve some insights from escape room players by relying on the numerous surveys being done throughout the industry. The annual _Escape Room Enthusiast Survey_ is specifically interesting, as it aggregates data from 3000 (self-proclaimed) enthusiasts <Citation id="elumir_2019a_2019" />.

## Elements of an Escape Room

What draws people to escape rooms differs from group to group, and from person to person. The survey ranks the importance of several elements within escape rooms. In 2019, the factors enthusiasts considered most important are:

1. Well designed puzzles and game flow
2. Novelty & Uniqueness
3. Immersion
4. Scenery, props & decor
5. Game Master quality

This isn't a comprehensive list of _everything_ an escape room has to do well. It does however provide us with a handhold to discuss the most important topics. We'll dig deep into each of these factors, and explain them through previously mentioned game theory.

## Designing extreme difficulty

Jesse Schell notes there is much debate about the difficulty of games. Whether it is a bad thing or a good thing to allow players to reach a level where they spend so much time in the frustration zone that they give up on the game. Some video games...

## Personal flow zones

Most escape room enthusiasts, those that have played lots of games before, have more skill than the typical novice player. Simultaneously, some novice players may be able to pick up the required skills to escape a room than others. Chen <Citation id="chen_2007_flow" hideAuthor /> describes this is typically solved by offering the player some kind of choice.

### Speaking with enthusiasts

- Enthusiast 1: Tends to shy away from an expert mode. It often feels like 'difficulty through omission', guessing what the designer had in mind.

- Enthusiast 2: Don't mind hints, I would much rather escape with help than without. However, this player didn't like systems that automatically give clues.

  > Automated hint systems, those make my [REDACTED] go limp.

- Enthusiast 3: Was very interested in the tech behind it. Often enjoys a behind-the-scenes that goes deep. Would like a way to reflect on his performance.

  > This is something I want; the ability to reflect on our team performance. To determine where we miscommunicated.

# How might we alter escape games based on players?

## Examples of dynamic difficulty

Now, dynamic difficulty isn't exactly a new idea. There are several examples of dynamic difficulty to be found, across several mediums. In the video gaming industry there are the obvious solutions like match-making (opponents are matched on experience level), but less obvious ones as well. I've also spoken to several escape game designers and hosts. To reveal some of the mysteries of dynamic game design in its current state, which we'll discuss in this section.

### Video games

- Metal Gear Solid 5
  - if you die often you get the option to wear a chicken hat
  - enemies respond to repetitive tactics
- Uncharted 4
  - The first puzzle is always the easiest, regardless of which location is visited first

### Consistency

Tommy Honton explained he sees the value in dynamic difficulty, but cares about the consistency of his experiences as well. He sees that as the main hurdle to overcome.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/tommy-honton-consistency.mp3" />

> The challenge for me is the idea of consistency. I want something that I make to be consistently good and enjoyable for novices and for experienced players.
>
> - Tommy Honton <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

The problem being that players, whatever their experience, wouldn't be able to discuss their experience with friends if they are wildly different.

<Callout>

Game designers want to create consistent experiences, so players of any level can talk about their experience without major disconnects.

</Callout>

In that sense escape rooms borrow the worst qualities of video games and movies. Many video games, especially open-world, invite players to play how they want to play. The difference is that video games are a fairly easy medium to return to. Playing an entire game or a specific section are something players do on the regular. Movies on the contrary, are a linear experience. They are harder to return to, but they are exactly the same for everyone that watches them. Save for the viewers' own interpretation and genre preferences.

### Opaque adaptation

Another important issue raised, is the need for ownership. Like self-determination theory said, people have the need to feel competent. People want to feel smart as they solve this escape room, to feel smarter than they thought they were. When escape rooms very obviously change according to the team playing, or when they are very forward with hints, we ruin that feeling. No longer will players feel like they were smart, they might even feel the exact opposite. Tommy Honton thinks the subtlety of hints and directing may solve some of those problems:

<PlayQuote src="/audio/tommy-light-feedback.mp3" />

> [B]eing able to, you know, solve some of those problems with the idea that a light glows and I look over, and I noticed the light and I don't connect the fact that I'm being hinted at.
>
> - Tommy Honton <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

Resident Evil 4 has hidden its adaptive nature incredibly well too, says Mark Brown <Citation id="" />. He adds the quality to hide this from players has another major benefit. When systems like these are unnoticeable players can't trick it. If players are aware that difficulty adapts to their performance, they might use it to cheat the game by making mistakes first, and picking up later. These ideas boil down to a single requirement.

<Callout>

Adaptive difficulty, including changes to game flow and being hinted at, should be imperceptible.

</Callout>

Eyal Danon believes the way we control escape rooms with software plays a big part in resolving these issues.

### Escape Room Software

Escape rooms have become more and more technical over the years. Integrating lighting, audio, moving items, projections and many other forms of interactive media. Primarily they form the basis for sensory immersion, but they have been used to build out other types of immersion as well. There are quite a few competitors in the space, though asking the [Escape Room Start Ups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ERstartups/permalink/2306313406330367) Facebook group has shown some prolific support for [Cogs](http://cogs.show), developed in part by Eyal Danon.

I've had the pleasure to speak with Eyal, who is an ex-escape room designer turned tech entrepreneur. Cogs runs interactive experience such as _escape rooms_, _immersive theatre_ and _experiential marketing_. Technically speaking, Cogs isn't just a piece of software though. They provide a suite of hardware to connect lights, music, projectors and bespoke puzzles as well. Essentially, it's a platform to make the design and implementation of interactive experiences as accessible as possible.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/eyal-danon-boring.mp3" />

> We've seen people do the most boring version, which is "it's 40 minutes and they still haven't got this open this cupboard, give them an easy clue". Which is very unsatisfying for the players. But we've also seen people do it in a much more elegant way.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/eyal-danon-slight-shifts.mp3" />

> Instead they kind of shift every single puzzle, just gets slightly easier or slightly harder, but it still fits well within the narrative. Or they just go "actually, we're going to give you a little bit more narrative in this direction".

> - Eyal Danon <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

<PlayQuote src="/audio/eyal-danon-sentiment-analysis.mp3" />

> We've done a little bit of work with sentiment analysis with the Cogs system. [...] Which we then shelved entirely, because regardless of whether groups are speaking, different languages, you will never really get enough sample data in order to create a really good machine model for every single room.
>
> - Eyal Danon <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

### Lab 13

Jesse van der Lely, from [Live Escape](https://liveescape.nl/lab13/), designed and hosts a room in Rotterdam called Lab13. Their system is completely opaque, and players never notice it, Jesse says. Their approach is that they start with a _base game._ They never remove any puzzles from the base game, but they do give faster teams (one or) a few extra puzzles, as determined by a big flow-diagram of yes and no statements. He mentions their base game has an escape rate of only 34%, an issue, since they're unable to make it easier than that. Another caveat that adds to this problem is that their current implementation doesn't allow for puzzles to become easier.

> When you show a clue to someone, you can't go back.
>
> - Jesse van der Lely (translated from Dutch) <Citation id="lely_2020_dynamic" />

Furthermore, Jesse mentions their room has multiple tracks. They use this to their advantage, by determining which puzzles are being solved first and fastest. If a team solves a logic puzzle really well they get more of those, if they do much better at a maths puzzle, that's what they get instead. Though the extra puzzles never build on story in a big way, to ensure a consistent experience across players. What Jesse is doing with Lab13 sounds like the first rudimentary approach to incorporate what Nicole Lazarro has with gaming. To offer different experiences to different types of players.

### Portable 'escape rooms'

Early on in my process, I spoke with David Middleton. Co-founder of the UK based _Bewilder Boffs Studios_, who offer services from concept to execution aimed at escape room startups. Bewilder Boffs has created their own series of escape rooms under the _Bewilder Box_ brand as well.

At the time of speaking, David was working on a mobile escape game. It all fits inside a box, and it had a specific set of constraints:

- 30 minute time limit
- Maximise the time people could play
- Scalable deployment

Their solution involves a self-resetting box, that offers clues on a set rhythm. The host-less experience lasts 30 minutes, and is broken up in 5 puzzle sections of 5 minutes (and some additional set-up/wind-down). Each puzzle drip-feeds clues through icons, and practically spells out the solution after 5 minutes have passed. That way, players who would normally get stuck, can move on to the next at the same pace as experienced players. that everyone gets the rush of almost (not) finishing.

### Metrics

- engagement
- momentum

<PlayQuote src="/audio/eyal-danon-momentum.mp3" />

> [T]he thing that we look at more than time is momentum. So you are designing some, a particular momentum. You want them to pick up whether they're a slow team while they're fasting, they're still picking up and then they slow down when they're towards the end.

# Conclusions / Key Insights

Escape room designers have to choose what they aim to do with dynamic difficulty. Some only desire to maximise the time each team gets to play their experience. While others might want to give everyone the rush of "almost not escaping". In both those cases we are dynamically controlling time and experience.

We determine puzzle difficulty by duration, might this be the wrong metric?

Ariel spoke about engagement. It's immediately clear when someone checks out.

Others might want to aim for focus. To maximise how long we can keep players attention and carefully planning moments of release. And finally we might want to aim for difficulty. Where we offer the right amount of cognitive challenge.

Now, these points might seem obvious, especially to avid escape room designers. But it took a while before they really sank in for me. To me, escape rooms are special in three ways compared to other mediums:

**They occur in a physical space.**
Result? Sensory immersion comes easy because:

- Result of _multi-channel information_
- _Completeness_ of information

**They are a group experience.**
The experience has to work for _multiple people,_ **at the same time**.
The experience has to work for varying group sizes.

**There is a time constraint.**
We promise an experience of _x minutes_. We better deliver.
