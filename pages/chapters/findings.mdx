title: "State of Escape Rooms"
subtitle: "Findings"
introduction: "Beyond what the literature says, there is a plethora of knowledge in the practice of escape room design, that's uncommon in theoretical analyses. Since escape room design is such a young industry, there are relatively few established rules. And the ones that do exist get experimented with or broken entirely, sometimes leading to a better experience. In this chapter, we'll learn how the real world differs from what the literature says."

# What makes or breaks an escape room experience?

Previously, we established a theoretical understanding of the inner workings of escape rooms. In practice a lot of nuancing needs to be done to fully understand what makes them tick.

### Puzzle flow in practice

The three models of puzzle flow Heikkinen & Shumeyko <Citation id="heikkinen-and-shumeyko_2016_designing" hideAuthor /> describe, do not portray a complete picture of reality. Real-world escape rooms often combine some or all of these approaches to complete an experience.

In reality, designers might gradually expose more and more rooms within the room. Or they might choose to direct players to work together, so they don't miss the most important story points of the experience.

Sherlocked's upcoming escape game illustrates this reality very well. Throughout the experience players have one end-goal, to perform an occult ritual. The figure below shows a stylised representation of the (preliminary) puzzle flowchart through time. Their access to rooms (yellow boxes) is gradually rolled out. However, players are often asked to backtrack and the team is directed to work on multiple puzzles at the same time.

:::

::: section small-width

Another great example is Dark Park's _The End_, which I played with my colleagues at Sherlocked (and cannot recommend enough). Their game is mostly linear, leading from one room to the next. It hosts a room that is about traversal, getting from one place to another. Another, is more puzzle-y in nature. A few puzzles are available at the same time. This allows teams to divide the work, and all of them have to be finished to 'solve' that room.

Designers combine the previously defined approaches to balance out the pros and cons of each. Sometimes they might chose to the experience of the individual over the team, and vice-versa. In other instances they might choose favour the progression of difficulty over the freedom of the players.

### Linearity gaining traction

As part of the panel I hosted, Nick Moran spoke about escape games moving increasingly to linear experience. Rather than having a task or puzzle for every player at any time.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/nick-moran-linear-trend.mp3" />

> The most praised games tend to be incredibly linear.
>
> - Nick Moran <Citation id="moran_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

## Puzzle Difficulty

Moran says linearity doesn't mean easier per se. But it does indicate a new found focus on story. It favours experiencing the narrative as a group, to connect with the emotional beats and keep the experience consistent across the group. Across the board, the people attending my panel said they aim to make escape rooms as accessible to mainstream players as they can. Most of them noted balancing difficult puzzles usually nudged them towards unfair.

### **Puzzle fairness**

Like discussed in the literature review, puzzles should be fair and enjoyable, if Errol Elumir is to be believed <Citation id="elumir_2018_13" /> What makes this especially true for escape rooms is that they are bound by a set time limit. Getting stuck hurts player experience in three ways:

1. It frustrates players in that moment
2. They start to distrust the game designer
3. Wastes time, and lessens the time left (of an otherwise potentially good experience)

During both panels I heard several perspectives on the matter. They don't contradict, but all favour different parts of looking at the same issue.

Tommy conveys the primary thing to look out for are unclear goals. He suggests this is easily recognised when players start mindlessly throwing things to see what sticks. When that happens puzzles are usually unfair. This response is clearly backed by the theory of flow and especially group flow as well. Since Csikszentmihalyi states flow only occurs when goals are clear.

Furthermore, Nick Moran makes an interesting distinction regarding difficulty. He identifies three separate categories, and says only one of them should be implemented at the same time.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/nick-moran-three-types-challenge.mp3" />

> To talk about fairness. So I think there are three sides to difficulty. Which is **physical difficulty**, **intellectual difficulty**, and the **difficulty of the unfamiliar**. And I think you can only ever have a puzzle that tests people in one of three of these areas. And that's what I think helps construct a fair puzzle.
>
> - Nick Moran <Citation id="moran_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

During the panel he explained what he exactly meant by that:

1. **Physical difficulty** — performing a task that is actually difficult. Like throwing a ball in a hoop.
2. **Intellectual difficulty** — the difficulty of understanding how something works.
3. **Difficulty of the unfamiliar** — puzzles that break prior understanding of escape games.

Puzzles that have that last characteristic are simply difficult because they are new. When players have seen lots of escape room puzzles and understand how they work, they are no longer difficult.

<Callout>

Regardless of difficulty, escape room designers should create fair and enjoyable puzzles.

</Callout>

### **Doing difficulty wrong**

It's important to be aware of some traps. Elumir thinks many escape rooms make the same errors when they try to increase difficulty <Citation id="elumir_2019b_how" hideAuthor />. He describes a few things that are important to be aware of when designing difficulty:

#### Identifying gates & puzzles

Identifying gates and collecting clues should be straightforward. Furthermore, Elumir says it should be obvious which puzzles to work on. This can be explained by the theory behind challenge-based immersion and flow. Remember that Csikszentmihalyi <Citation id="snyder_2005_handbook" hideAuthor /> said flow occurs when goals are achievable? And that Sawyer <Citation id="sawyer_2008_group" /> said groups experiencing flow have common goals? A team that is unsure what goal to achieve, ergo which puzzle to solve, won't experience flow.

#### Beware of revelatory puzzles

Puzzles that take a lot of logic leaps, those that make you say _'eureka'_, are hard to do well. While enthusiasts may enjoy them a lot for their challenge. Adding too many will exclude mainstream players. When players solve these types of puzzles they might feel better about themselves, but when they don't they get frustrated.

#### Tedium

Beware of adding tedium, like unscrewing lots of screws instead of few. You may be able to slow players down, but it won't be more difficult or challenging. Players will get bored and disengage, instead of feeling challenged.

#### Entering combinations

Elumir says, to beware of difficult to enter combinations. He thinks that when players are aware of a solution, they should be able put in the solution fairly quickly. A great example of this going wrong is _The Vault_. They used to have players open a (near) antique vault that's been there almost as long as the building itself. Opening a combination lock is easier said than done. Even if players were able to do so, the vault would vacuum seal from time to time, which would make it impossible to open. In theory it does a lot right, it effectively it blurs the lines between fiction and reality, but isn't a fun puzzle itself. This interaction has been changed since I played the vault. Even if it's less realistic, it's probably for the better.

When these rules get broken, puzzles are no longer considered fair or fun.

### Distributing difficulty

Theory has shown the importance of game flow, as discussed previously. Linear, story driven (video) games actively direct where players should look, and as a result influence how the player _should_ feel during certain scenes.

These three examples show the variety (video) game designers have played with to craft a well-rounded experience. Carefully moderating challenge is essential to a good gameplay experience. Too much tension, and we wear out. Too much relaxation, and we grow bored. When the conditions previously described are met, experience seamlessly unfolds from moment to moment.

Escape room designers use different approaches to achieve the same result. Juliana Moreno Patel mentioned two techniques she uses to distribute difficulty throughout an escape game. On a meta level, both her and Ariel mention a bell curve.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/ariel-rubin-bellcurve.mp3" />

> When you're going into the bell curve of difficulty, having easy puzzles at the beginning really possible things gets your players to trust you. They say, okay, this is a game I'm going to be able to do.
>
> - Ariel Rubin <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

They say generally they start players off easy, something Victor has mentioned to do as well. They crank up the difficulty around the middle of the game, where most players are around their optimal experience. Near the end they actually tend to scale difficulty down again. Since most players won't be as sharp as when they started, and stress of the time limit starts to set in.

Regarding difficult puzzles, Juliana mentions that it's important to drip-feed players some tiny milestones, so they feel like they're making progress. Even if it's slow.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/juliana-breadcrumbs.mp3" />

> If they can be looking at this puzzle and at least figure out one small piece of it, where that really seems right, it's going to give them that rush and it's going to give them the desire to continue.
>
> - Juliana Moreno Patel <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

Tommy Honton mentions that recent escape rooms have started adding more rooms. They use surprise often to make players disconnect from their previous challenge and environment. Those moments are distributed throughout the experience, which allows players to realise what effects their actions had on the world they interacted with.

> Each room that opens up, you have a moment of disconnecting what opened up, and taking in that new data.
>
> - Tommy Honton <Citation id="constructedadventures_2020_interview" hideAuthor />

If the escape room enthusiast survey is anything to go by, proper challenge is extremely important to escape rooms. As a metric in itself, but it's important as a prerequisite for immersion as well. Offering a cognitively demanding, though achievable, experience seems to be a major key to success in games and escape rooms alike.

### Puzzle testing

Like I said about Bates' essay, as an experience I gain player empathy through research. To actually connect with people in order to understand what they need. Escape room designers seem to have integrated this process as well. Ariel Rubin was very clear about its importance:

<PlayQuote src="/audio/ariel-rubin-playtesting.mp3" />

> The very, very best way to find [frustration] and to figure it out is through play testing.
>
> - Ariel Rubin <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

Sherlocked is working on a new experience (which I probably shouldn't have told you about 🤐), which I've played a role in during these past few months. I've been a player, designer of a puzzle and documenting using photo and video, although not all at the same time.

![](/img/playtest-3.png)

Later we set up a test with people I didn't know, which we set up on-location at a new location in the Beurs van Berlage. We had set up about 5-6 interactions to test the tech and time players needed, but most of all on their ability to make players smile.

<SideBySide>

![](/img/playtest-1.jpg)
![](/img/playtest-2.jpg)

</SideBySide>

Since we had several subsequent tests in that last session, we were able to make some tiny adjustments in one day. Slowly improving the experience as we collected feedback. It also resulted in scrapping one of the puzzles I'd designed, which you have to be able to deal with as an escape room designer.

#### Iteration

Interestingly, running an escape room inherently means you're doing research on the experience you provide. Game hosts watch in on every game played, and instantly pick up when players disconnect from the experience. It made me think of advice from Jason Fried, who said the only way to iterate on a product is to put it out in the world.

<blockquote className="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    You can only iterate on something after it’s been released. Prior to
    release, you’re just making the thing. Even if you change it, you’re just
    making it. Iterating is when you change/improve after it’s out. So if you
    want to iterate, SHIP.
  </p>
  &mdash; Jason Fried (@jasonfried) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/935555293014036480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2017</a>
</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charSet="utf-8" />

In that sense, escape rooms test almost like a restaurant improves its menu, constantly receiving passive and active feedback can be used for every subsequent game, provided you actually use that knowledge. Like restaurants, escape room businesses are generally quite small, by which I mean, the line from customer to the one providing the experience is quite short.

## Conflicts of immersion

Escape rooms as a medium do well in some parts of immersion, but have much to improve in other areas. As Haley Cooper <Citation id="cooper_2018_immersive" hideAuthor /> notes, the nature of escape rooms hinders the narrative immersion some other mediums do offer because spaces don't feel real. Furthermore, agency takes away control of pacing.

Some of these conflicts of interest have been partially resolved though. There have certainly been attempts to make the three work better together. At Sherlocked they use several techniques to blur the lines between reality and fiction. These exist elsewhere in the industry, but they are certainly not employed in every experience.

### Blurring when the experience starts

One of the things Sherlocked's _The Vault_ is praised for is its ability to conceal when the experience has started. You'll get some cryptic text messages, and slowly but surely you're rolling into an immersive adventure. There is no host to receive you as the host of Sherlocked. Instead, you'll have to word-wrestle your way into a high-class art gallery. Leaving your coats and phone all happens in-story. You never stop to think 'oh _now_ we're _really_ getting started'. The gradual introduction to the story has you questioning afterwards when the experience actually did start. That is something Victor thinks Sherlocked does best.

### Make the solution to the puzzle depend on the story

Another area to focus on is using puzzles as a touchpoint for the narrative. A winning technique is to make the challenge and story co-depend on each other. In order to progress through the escape room, players _have_ to know the story. Victor, notes that it's important to make this clear from the start. To set a precedent for late-game puzzles. Victor uses this as a hook to draw even the most puzzle-savvy players into the narrative.

> The trick is to make it clear from the start that you can’t achieve the one without the other. That in order to complete the game, you need to understand the story.
>
> - Victor van Doorn

For Sherlocked, one of their primary goals designing new experiences is to have you guessing whether what just happened is real. An excellent anecdote of them succeeding at that promise is the story Victor told me of a game he once hosted. He told me about a group of players from Saudi Arabia that didn't want to continue _The Vault._ They genuinely believed to be participating in an actual heist. While not every player responds as strongly, at least some people have been second-guessing.

### Use of historical figures and places

The last point Sherlocked seems to excel is that their narrative design is heavily inspired by real historical characters. Borrowing names, like Tesla and Newton to instantly connect the narrative with the real world. They employ historical figures as a basis for the narrative. In a similar vein, they use real places. Their sets are constructed within the confines of a monumental building. _The Vault_, for example, is built within the vault room at _Beurs van Berlage,_ which instantly grants their story some credibility. Their experiences borrow characteristics from docudrama feature films (eg. Bohemian Rhapsody) along with science fiction (eg. Star Wars). Thus ultimately falling somewhere in between.

# How does the experience of enthusiasts differ from other players?

Fortunately, there has been extensive — though mostly unscientific — market research on player preferences. We can quickly retrieve some insights from escape room players by relying on the numerous surveys being done throughout the industry. The annual _Escape Room Enthusiast Survey_ is specifically interesting, as it aggregates data from 3000 (self-proclaimed) enthusiasts <Citation id="elumir_2019a_2019" />.

## Elements of an Escape Room

What draws people to escape rooms differs from group to group, and from person to person. The survey ranks the importance of several elements within escape rooms. In 2019, the factors enthusiasts considered most important are:

1. Well designed puzzles and game flow
2. Novelty & Uniqueness
3. Immersion
4. Scenery, props & decor
5. Game Master quality

This isn't a comprehensive list of _everything_ an escape room has to do well. It does however provide us with a handhold to discuss the most important topics. We'll dig deep into each of these factors, and explain them through previously mentioned game theory.

## Personal flow zones

Most escape room enthusiasts, those that have played lots of games before, have more skill than the typical novice player. Simultaneously, some novice players may be able to pick up the required skills to escape a room than others. Chen <Citation id="chen_2007_flow" hideAuthor /> describes this is typically solved by offering the player some kind of choice.

### Designing extreme difficulty

Jesse Schell notes there is much debate about the difficulty of games. Whether it is a bad thing or a good thing to allow players to reach a level where they spend so much time in the frustration zone that they give up on the game. Some video games...

<PlayQuote src="/audio/tommy-balancing-fair.mp3" />

> I don't mind crunching at something difficulty wise, both as a designer and hoping people enjoy that same thing, and also as a player. Provided it as satisfying and fair. And that's I think the big balancing act is making something fair.
>
> - Tommy Honton <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

### Speaking with enthusiasts

- Enthusiast 1: Tends to shy away from an expert mode. It often feels like 'difficulty through omission', guessing what the designer had in mind.

<Callout>

Enthusiasts are not fundamentally against harder difficulty, but the industry has to gain the trust of players by making hard difficulty games that are fair.

</Callout>

- Enthusiast 2: Don't mind hints, I would much rather escape with help than without. However, this player didn't like systems that automatically give clues.

  > Automated hint systems, those make my [REDACTED] go limp.

- Enthusiast 3: Was very interested in the tech behind it. Often enjoys a behind-the-scenes that goes deep. Would like a way to reflect on his performance.

  > This is something I want; the ability to reflect on our team performance. To determine where we miscommunicated.

# How might we alter escape games based on players?

Now, dynamic difficulty isn't exactly a new idea. There are several examples of dynamic difficulty to be found, across several mediums. In the video gaming industry there are the obvious solutions like match-making (opponents are matched on experience level). And escape rooms have used less obvious ones as well. I've spoken with several escape game designers and hosts, and analysed video games. With the purpose of revealing some of the mysteries of dynamic game design in its current state, which we'll discuss in this section.

### Video games

The lowest hanging fruit is looking at video games. They are easy to find examples of (and fun to play as part of research). Video games get reviewed and analysed a lot, and have become an important part of pop culture <Citation id="wolf_2017_video" />.

The majority of games actually don't incorporate dynamic difficulty at all. Instead, they give the player the option to choose a difficulty level. This would solve some problems with dynamic difficulty, like rating escape games

- Metal Gear Solid 5
  - if you die often you get the option to wear a chicken hat
  - enemies respond to repetitive tactics
- Uncharted 4
  - The first puzzle is always the easiest, regardless of which location is visited first

### Consistency

Tommy Honton explained he sees the value in dynamic difficulty, but cares about the consistency of his experiences as well. He sees that as the main hurdle to overcome.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/tommy-honton-consistency.mp3" />

> The challenge for me is the idea of consistency. I want something that I make to be consistently good and enjoyable for novices and for experienced players.
>
> - Tommy Honton <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

The problem being that players, whatever their experience, wouldn't be able to discuss their experience with friends if they are wildly different.

<Callout>

Game designers want to create consistent experiences, so players of any level can talk about their experience without major disconnects.

</Callout>

In that sense escape rooms borrow the worst qualities of video games and movies. Many video games, especially open-world, invite players to play how they want to play. The difference is that video games are a fairly easy medium to return to. Playing an entire game or a specific section are something players do on the regular. Movies on the contrary, are a linear experience. They are harder to return to, but they are exactly the same for everyone that watches them. Save for the viewers' own interpretation and genre preferences.

### Opaque adaptation

Another important issue raised, is the need for ownership. Like self-determination theory said, people have the need to feel competent. People want to feel smart as they solve this escape room, to feel smarter than they thought they were. When escape rooms very obviously change according to the team playing, or when they are very forward with hints, we ruin that feeling. No longer will players feel like they were smart, they might even feel the exact opposite. Like enthusiast #2, Tommy Honton feels like mis-timed or overt hints are jarring to the experience, and break immersion. He thinks hints that subtly direct players may solve some of those problems:

<PlayQuote src="/audio/tommy-light-feedback.mp3" />

> [B]eing able to, you know, solve some of those problems with the idea that a light glows and I look over, and I noticed the light and I don't connect the fact that I'm being hinted at.
>
> - Tommy Honton <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

Resident Evil 4 has hidden its adaptive nature incredibly well too, says Mark Brown <Citation id="" />. He adds the quality to hide this from players has another major benefit. When systems like these are unnoticeable players can't trick it. If players are aware that difficulty adapts to their performance, they might use it to cheat the game by making mistakes first, and picking up later. These ideas boil down to a single requirement.

<Callout>

Adaptive difficulty, including changes to game flow and being hinted at, should be imperceptible.

</Callout>

Eyal Danon believes the way we control escape rooms with software plays a big part in resolving these issues.

### Escape Room Software

Escape rooms have become more and more technical over the years. Integrating lighting, audio, moving items, projections and many other forms of interactive media. Primarily they form the basis for sensory immersion, but they have been used to build out other types of immersion as well. There are quite a few competitors in the space, though asking the [Escape Room Start Ups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ERstartups/permalink/2306313406330367) Facebook group has shown some prolific support for [Cogs](http://cogs.show), developed in part by Eyal Danon.

I've had the pleasure to speak with Eyal, who is an ex-escape room designer turned tech entrepreneur. Cogs runs interactive experience such as _escape rooms_, _immersive theatre_ and _experiential marketing_. Technically speaking, Cogs isn't just a piece of software though. They provide a suite of hardware to connect lights, music, projectors and bespoke puzzles as well. Essentially, it's a platform to make the design and implementation of interactive experiences as accessible as possible.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/eyal-danon-boring.mp3" />

> We've seen people do the most boring version, which is "it's 40 minutes and they still haven't got this open this cupboard, give them an easy clue". Which is very unsatisfying for the players. But we've also seen people do it in a much more elegant way.
>
> - Eyal Danon <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

<PlayQuote src="/audio/eyal-danon-slight-shifts.mp3" />

> Instead they kind of shift every single puzzle, just gets slightly easier or slightly harder, but it still fits well within the narrative. Or they just go "actually, we're going to give you a little bit more narrative in this direction".
>
> - Eyal Danon <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

### Metrics

If we consider the solution to dynamic difficulty a system with inputs and outputs. We have to define metrics that will indicate whether a group is currently experiencing the right level of difficulty.

During the panel I explained that I suspect team communication to be a good indicator for flow. My statement was based on a triplet of theories:

- Jesse Schell's observation that multiplayer video game players experiencing flow often communicate enthusiastically with each other
- Keith Sawyer's conditions for group flow
- Marlow's meta-analysis of team communication showing clear indicators for team familiarity

Ariel Rubin said she thought I was on the right track, but that engagement and frustration are the best indicators to look at.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/ariel-rubin-engagement.mp3" />

> Engagement is really the thing. Cause I think consistently what you will see is as people get frustrated, they start fussing with things or they just sit down for awhile. It's it's how engaged are they in continuing to solve? And how many mistakes they make.
>
> - Ariel Rubin <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

Ariel also mentioned groups make mistakes more often when they are disengaged. When players disengage they usually start brute forcing puzzles, and lose interest in learning _how_ they should solve the puzzle. Which is troublesome when escape games want to implement Jonathan Blow's puzzle language philosophy. Being aware when that happens is important to consider for later interactions.

Eyal had a different answer to the same question. Like Tommy said about clear goals, it's important that teams keep moving forward. He generally suggests escape rooms use _momentum_ as an indicator for enjoyment. By which he means they pick up pace as they play, increasingly solving more and more puzzles in the same time. It doesn't matter whether a group is faster or slower than the one before, but the overall momentum of the group should go up right near the end. Essentially, they play against their own previous performance.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/eyal-danon-momentum.mp3" />

> [T]he thing that we look at more than time is momentum. So you are designing some, a particular momentum. You want them to pick up whether they're a slow team while they're fasting, they're still picking up and then they slow down when they're towards the end.
>
> - Eyal Danon <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

Eyal says he's also tried to use sentiment analysis, inferring how players feel based on language, as an input for Cogs as well. However, he says the technical implementation of a system like this is problematic in practice.

<PlayQuote src="/audio/eyal-danon-sentiment-analysis.mp3" />

> We've done a little bit of work with sentiment analysis with the Cogs system. [...] Which we then shelved entirely.
>
> - Eyal Danon <Citation id="patel_2021_panel" hideAuthor />

Between groups not be speaking a lot as part of cultural differences, or groups speaking different languages entirely and every room being different, it's hard to get enough sample data. If you know anything about machine learning, you'll know that's exactly what's required to create a really good machine learning model.

Beyond some specific input types I've also spoken with a few designers of dynamic difficulty in escape rooms (or similar).

### Full systems in the wild

#### Lab13

Jesse van der Lely, from [Live Escape](https://liveescape.nl/lab13/), designed and hosts a room in Rotterdam called Lab13. Their system is completely opaque, and players never notice it, Jesse says. Their approach is that they start with a _base game._ They never remove any puzzles from the base game, but they do give faster teams (one or) a few extra puzzles, as determined by a big flow-diagram of yes and no statements. He mentions their base game has an escape rate of only 34%, an issue, since they're unable to make it easier than that. Another caveat that adds to this problem is that their current implementation doesn't allow for puzzles to become easier.

> When you show a clue to someone, you can't go back.
>
> - Jesse van der Lely (translated from Dutch) <Citation id="lely_2020_dynamic" hideAuthor />

Furthermore, Jesse mentions their room has multiple tracks. They use this to their advantage, by determining which puzzles are being solved first and fastest. If a team solves a logic puzzle really well they get more of those, if they do much better at a maths puzzle, that's what they get instead. Though the extra puzzles never build on story in a big way, to ensure a consistent experience across players. What Jesse is doing with Lab13 sounds like the first rudimentary approach to incorporate what Nicole Lazarro has with gaming. To offer different experiences to different types of players.

#### Push the Button

Early on in my process, I spoke with David Middleton. Co-founder of the UK based _Bewilder Boffs Studios_, who offer services from concept to execution aimed at escape room startups. Bewilder Boffs has created their own series of escape rooms under the _Bewilder Box_ brand as well.

At the time of speaking, David was working on a mobile escape game. It all fits inside a box, and it had a specific set of constraints:

- 30 minute time limit
- Maximise the time people could play
- Scalable deployment

Their solution involves a self-resetting box, that offers clues on a set rhythm. The host-less experience lasts 30 minutes, and is broken up in 5 puzzle sections of 5 minutes (and some additional set-up/wind-down). Each puzzle drip-feeds clues through icons, and practically spells out the solution after 5 minutes have passed. That way, players who would normally get stuck, can move on to the next at the same pace as experienced players. that everyone gets the rush of almost (not) finishing.

> The idea is to get everyone in that James Bond phase of the game
>
> - David Middleton <Citation id="middleton_2020_dynamic" hideAuthor />

#### The Gallery

One of the first people I spoke to for this project is Niels Jonker <Citation id="jonker_2020_dynamic" hideAuthor /> from Escapist, another escape room business in Amsterdam. Niels Jonker has designed _The Gallery_, another escape room featuring dynamic difficulty. He actually said it's quite easy to do, and like David, he tries to get every group to escape at around 58 minutes, which he said is to maximise 'value for money'. Niels made three particularly interesting points:

- The Gallery was initially a 'normal' escape room, but dynamic difficulty was later added since the record was set at 36 minutes, which he thought was too short for a 60 minute experience
- Result of supporting large variations in group sizes. Groups of two people are inherently less fast than those with more people playing at the same time.
- He only starts adjusting puzzles in the second half of the game. Early on the game it's really hard get a grasp on the team's speed.

# Conclusions / Key Insights

Escape room designers have to choose what they aim to do with dynamic difficulty. Some only desire to maximise the time each team gets to play their experience. While others might want to give everyone the rush of "almost not escaping". In both those cases we are dynamically controlling time and experience.

Ariel spoke about engagement. It's immediately clear when someone checks out.

Others might want to aim for focus. To maximise how long we can keep players attention and carefully planning moments of release. And finally we might want to aim for difficulty. Where we offer the right amount of cognitive challenge.

Now, these points might seem obvious, especially to avid escape room designers. But it took a while before they really sunk in for me. To me, escape rooms are special in three ways compared to other forms of entertainment:

Sensory immersion comes easy as a result of:

- Multi-channel information
- Completeness of information

<Callout title="They are a group experience">

The experience has to work for **multiple people**, at the _same time_.
The experience has to work for **varying group sizes**.

</Callout>

<Callout title="There is a time constraint">

Escape rooms promise an experience of x minutes. We better deliver.
