title: "State of Escape Rooms"
subtitle: "Findings"
introduction: "Beyond what the literature says, there is a plethora of knowledge in the practice of escape room design, that's uncommon in theoretical analyses. Since escape room design is such a young industry, there are relatively few established rules. And the ones that do exist get experimented with or broken entirely, sometimes leading to a better experience. In this chapter, we'll learn how the real world differs from what the literature says."

# The State of Escape Rooms

Previously, we established a theoretical understanding of the inner workings of escape rooms. In practice a lot of nuancing needs to be done to fully understand the situation.

### Puzzle flow

In reality, even these three models do not show a complete picture. Escape rooms often combine some or all of these approaches in an experience. In reality, designers might gradually expose more and more rooms within the room. Or they might choose to direct players to work together, so they don't miss the most important story points of the experience.

Sherlocked's upcoming experience illustrates this reality very well. Throughout the experience players have one end-goal, to perform a ritual. The figure below shows a stylised representation of the (preliminary) game flow. Their access to rooms (yellow boxes) is gradually rolled out, but many-a-times players will work on multiple puzzles at the same time.

Another great example is Dark Park's _The End_, which I played with my colleagues at Sherlocked (and cannot recommend enough). Their game is mostly linear, leading from one room to the next. It hosts a room that is about traversal, getting from one place to another. Another, is more puzzle-y in nature. A few puzzles are available at the same time. This allows teams to divide the work, and all of them have to be finished to 'solve' that room.

Designers combine the previously defined approaches to balance out the pros and cons of each. Sometimes they might chose to the experience of the individual over the team, and vice-versa. In other instances they might choose favour the progression of difficulty over the freedom of the players.

## Puzzle Difficulty

According to Victor _Designing the Puzzle_ is _the_ piece to read on puzzle design. <Citation id="bates_1997_designing" />.

### Puzzle testing

- Escape rooms run routinely, and game hosts watch in on every game played.
- In that sense, escape rooms test almost like a restaurant improves its menu, constantly receiving passive and active feedback

### Doing difficulty wrong

It's important to be aware of some traps. Elumir thinks many escape rooms make the same errors when they try to increase difficulty <Citation id="elumir_2019b_how" hideAuthor />. He describes five things to look out for when designing for difficulty:

1. Identifying gates and collecting clues should be straightforward
2. It should be obvious which puzzles to work on
3. Revelatory puzzles (aha) are hard to do well, adding too many excludes mainstream players
4. Don't add tedium to slow players down, ex. unscrewing lots of screws instead of few
5. Don't make it difficult to enter a combination

### Moderating game flow

Theory has shown the importance of game flow, as discussed previously. Linear, story driven (video) games actively control how the player should feel during certain scenes.

These three examples show the variety (video) game designers have played with previously. Carefully moderating challenge is essential to a good gameplay experience. Too much tension, and we wear out. Too much relaxation, and we grow bored. When the conditions previously described are met, experience seamlessly unfolds from moment to moment.

Escape room designers use different approaches to solve the same issue. Tommy Honton mentions escape rooms often surprise players to have them disconnect from their previous challenge. They pace out moments to make players realise what an action just did to the world they interact with.

> Each room that opens up, you have a moment of disconnecting what opened up, and taking in that new data.
>
> - Tommy Honton <Citation id="constructed_2020_interview" hideAuthor />

If the escape room enthusiast survey is anything to go by, proper challenge is extremely important to escape rooms. As a metric in itself, but it's important as a prerequisite for immersion as well. Offering a cognitively demanding, though achievable, experience seems to be a major key to success in games and escape rooms alike.

## Conflicts of immersion

Escape rooms as a medium do well in some parts of immersion, but have much to improve in other areas. As Haley Cooper <Citation id="cooper_2017_immersive" hideAuthor /> notes, the nature of escape rooms hinders the narrative immersion some other mediums do offer because spaces don't feel real. Furthermore, agency takes away control of pacing.

Some of these conflicts of interest have been partially resolved though. There have certainly been attempts to make the three work better together. At Sherlocked they use several techniques to blur the lines between reality and fiction. These exist elsewhere in the industry, but they are certainly not employed in every experience.

### Blurring when the experience starts

Sherlocked's _The Vault_ is praised for another quality. They never really tell you when the experience has started. You'll get some cryptic text messages, and slowly but surely you're rolling into an immersive adventure. There is no host to receive you as the host of Sherlocked. Instead, you'll have to word-wrestle your way into a high-class art gallery. Leaving your coats and phone all happens in-story. You never stop to think 'oh _now_ we're _really_ getting started'. The gradual introduction to the story has you questioning afterwards when the experience actually did start. That is something Victor thinks Sherlocked does best.

### Make the solution to the puzzle depend on the story

Another area to focus on is using puzzles as a touchpoint for the narrative. A winning technique is to make the challenge and story co-depend on each other. In order to progress through the escape room, players _have_ to know the story. Victor, notes that it's important to make this clear from the start. To set a precedent for late-game puzzles. Victor uses this as a hook to draw even the most puzzle-savvy players into the narrative.

> The trick is to make it clear from the start that you can’t achieve the one without the other. That in order to complete the game, you need to understand the story.
>
> - Victor van Doorn

For Sherlocked, one of their primary goals designing new experiences is to have you guessing whether what just happened is real. An excellent anecdote of them succeeding at that promise is the story Victor told me of a game he once hosted. He told me about a group of players from Saudi Arabia that didn't want to continue _The Vault._ They genuinely believed to be participating in an actual heist. While not every player responds as strongly, at least some people have been second-guessing.

### Use of history

From working with Sherlocked I've noticed their narrative design is heavily inspired by real historical characters. Borrowing names, like Tesla and Newton to instantly connect the narrative with the real world. They employ historical figures as a basis for the narrative. In a similar vein, they use real places. Their sets are constructed within the confines of a monumental building. _The Vault_, for example, is built within the vault room at _Beurs van Berlage,_ which instantly grants their story some credibility. Their experiences borrow characteristics from docudrama feature films (eg. Bohemian Rhapsody) as well as science fiction (eg. Star Wars). Thus ultimately falling somewhere in between.

# What Enthusiasts look for

Fortunately, there has been extensive — though mostly unscientific — market research on player preferences. We can quickly retrieve some insights from escape room players by relying on the numerous surveys being done throughout the industry. The annual _Escape Room Enthusiast Survey_ is specifically interesting, as it aggregates data from 3000 (self-proclaimed) enthusiasts <Citation id="elumir_2019a_2019" />.

## Elements of an Escape Room

What draws people to escape rooms differs from group to group, and from person to person. The survey ranks the importance of several elements within escape rooms. In 2019, the factors enthusiasts considered most important are:

1. Well designed puzzles and game flow
2. Novelty & Uniqueness
3. Immersion
4. Scenery, props & decor
5. Game Master quality

This isn't a comprehensive list of _everything_ an escape room has to do well. It does however provide us with a handhold to discuss the most important topics. We'll dig deep into each of these factors, and explain them through previously mentioned game theory.

## Designing extreme difficulty

Jesse Schell notes there is much debate about the difficulty of games. Whether it is a bad thing or a good thing to allow players to reach a level where they spend so much time in the frustration zone that they give up on the game. Some video games...

## Personal flow zones

Most escape room enthusiasts that have played lots of games before they start their next experience have more skill than the typical novice player. Simultaneously, some novice players may be able to pick up the required skills to escape a room than others. Chen <Citation id="chen_2007_flow" hideAuthor /> describes this is typically solved by offering the player some kind of choice.

### Speaking with enthusiasts

- Enthusiast 1: Tends to shy away from an expert mode. It often feels like 'difficulty through omission', guessing what the designer had in mind.
- Enthusiast 2: Don't mind hints, I would much rather escape with help than without. However, this player didn't like systems that automatically give clues.

  > Automated hint systems, those make my [REDACTED] go limp.

- Enthusiast 3: Was very interested in the tech behind it. Often enjoys a behind-the-scenes that goes deep. Would like a way to reflect on his performance.

  > This is something I want; the ability to reflect on our team performance. To determine where we miscommunicated.

# Dynamic game design

## Examples of dynamic difficulty

Now, dynamic difficulty isn't exactly a new idea. There are several examples of dynamic difficulty to be found, across several mediums. In the video gaming industry there are the obvious solutions like match-making (opponents are matched on experience level), but less obvious ones as well. I've also spoken to several escape game designers and hosts. To reveal some of the mysteries of dynamic game design in its current state, which we'll discuss in this section.

### Video games

- Metal Gear Solid 5
  - if you die often you get the option to wear a chicken hat
  - enemies respond to repetitive tactics
- Resident Evil 4
  - very opaque dynamic difficulty
- Uncharted 4
  - The first puzzle is always the easiest, regardless of which location is visited first

### Escape Room Software

Eyal Danon, escape room designer turned tech entrepreneur, on [Cogs](http://cogs.show):

<PlayQuote url="/audio/eyal-danon-boring.mp3" />

> We've seen people do the most boring version, which is "it's 40 minutes and they still haven't got this open this cupboard, give them an easy clue". Which is very unsatisfying for the players. But we've also seen people do it in a much more elegant way.
>

<PlayQuote url="/audio/eyal-danon-slight-shifts.mp3" />

> Instead they kind of shift every single puzzle, just gets slightly easier or slightly harder, but it still fits well within the narrative. Or they just go "actually, we're going to give you a little bit more narrative in this direction".
>

<PlayQuote url="/audio/eyal-danon-sentiment-analysis.mp3" />

> We've done a little bit of work with sentiment analysis with the Cogs system. [...] Which we then shelved entirely, because regardless of whether groups are speaking, different languages, you will never really get enough sample data in order to create a really good machine model for every single room.

### Portable 'escape rooms'

- David Middleton (Bewilder Boffs/Bewilder Box)

> "get everyone in that James Bond phase of the game"

Early on in my process, I spoke with David Middleton. Co-founder of the UK based _Bewilder Boffs Studios_, who offer services from concept to execution aimed at escape room startups. Bewilder Boffs has created their own series of escape rooms under the _Bewilder Box_ brand as well.

They created an online escape room, general escape room, it was taking some people 2 and a half hours to finish. Aimed at general public, but they were getting tired, it was less enjoyable for them. Then they made it easier, but enthusiasts were less happy with the experience.

At the time of speaking, David was working on a mobile escape game. It all fits inside a box to go, and it had a specific set of constraints:

- 30 minute time limit
- Maximise the time people could play
- Scalable

Their solution involves a self-resetting box, that offers clues on a set rhythm. The host-less experience lasts 30 minutes, and is broken up in 5 puzzle sections of 5 minutes (and some additional set-up/wind-down). Each puzzle drip-feeds clues through icons, and practically spells out the solution after 5 minutes have passed. That way, players who would normally get stuck, can move on to the next at the same pace as experienced players. He does mention there is a skip button available when players still get stuck once all clues have arrived. Which he says is integrated into the theme, but not something he would implement in another experience.

### Escape Rooms

- Jesse van der Lely (Lab13/Live Escape)
- Niels Jonker (Escapist)

- Diagram of Marlow's theory (ex):
  - A: groepen kennen elkaar niet. Communicatie frequentie is lager(?) en niet efficient, dus groep presteert slecht
  - B: Groepen kennen elkaar een beetje: communicatie frequentie is hoog en niet efficient, groep presteert medium
  - C: groepen kennen elkaar goed: communicatie frequentie is laag maar efficient, groep presteert goed

### Metrics

- engagement
- momentum

<PlayQuote url="/audio/eyal-danon-momentum.mp3" />

> [T]he thing that we look at more than time is momentum. So you are designing some, a particular momentum. You want them to pick up whether they're a slow team while they're fasting, they're still picking up and then they're slowing down when they're towards the end.

# Conclusions / Key Insights

Escape room designers have to choose what they aim to do. Some have wanted to maximize time played. While others might want to give everyone the rush of "almost not escaping". In both those cases we are dynamically controlling time and experience.

- We determine puzzle difficulty by duration, might this be the wrong metric?

Others might want to aim for focus. To maximize how long we can keep players attention and carefully planning moments of release. And finally we might want to aim for difficulty. Where we offer the right amount of cognitive challenge.

Now, these points might seem obvious, especially to avid escape room designers. But it took a while before they really sank in for me. Escape rooms are special in three ways:

**They occur in a physical space.**
Result? Sensory immersion comes easy because:

- Result of _multi-channel information_
- _Completeness_ of information

**They are a group experience.**
The experience has to work for _multiple people_ at the same time.
The experience has to work for varying group sizes.

**There is a time constraint.**
We promise an experience of _x minutes_. We better deliver.
