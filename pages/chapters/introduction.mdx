## Rise of the escape room

It's hard to say for sure how escape rooms really came into existence. Sugar explains how the history of escape rooms is a little bit dicey. What counts as the first escape room as we currently know them? The general consensus within the industry seems to be that modern escape rooms debuted in one of two places. While Takao Kato was certainly the first to design a modern escape room, based in Kyoto, Japan, escape rooms didn't hit major commercial success before 2012. One might argue ParaPark, opened in 2011 in Budapest by Attila Gyurkovics, is what has caused the escape room market to explode <Citation id="sugar_2019_the" />. Whatever the reason was, it's clear that the market for escape rooms has seen meteoric growth since 2014.

### What _is_ an escape room?

Like most young product markets, escape rooms as we know them have changed a lot in these first few years too. Most people will know them by their original definition, Victor from Sherlocked describes as follows:

> The original pitch was something like this: you’re locked in a room with 5 friends and together you have to solve puzzles and challenges to get out within 60 minutes.
>
> - Victor van Doorn

During my work with them it's become clear that definition has stretched and bent out of shape. Escape rooms have stuck with their name, but have grown beyond that in various ways. For example, Sherlocked's 'escape room' _The Vault_ was one of the first to do a break-in experience well. Escape rooms have fostered a scene of creatives, making all sorts of immersive live-experiences. Rachel Sugar writes they no longer are a room you have to escape from, but an experience that offer a temporary escape from normal life <Citation id="sugar_2019_the" />. Victor notes they have become an umbrella term for entertainment featuring cinematic adventures, dedicated to originality, narrative and immersion.

> We’re part of a revolution in live entertainment, by showing customers that their lives, for an hour at a time, can be like a movie.
>
> - Victor van Doorn

### Growth

Room Escape Artist manages a database of US based escape rooms. Their analysis shows how the number of escape rooms has grown from just 24 in 2014, to 2250 in 2020 <Citation id="" hideAuthor />.

For the past few years, the demand for entertainment seems to have been able to sustain the increasing number of escape rooms. Though 2020 might show the first year this doesn't seem to be the case, I suspect COVID-19 has caused a sharp decline of permanent closings this year. Whether that trend continues after we've escaped the pandemic remains to be seen.

### What's the big deal?

We can determine that some people have enjoyed escape rooms extensively by looking on Dutch website [Escapetalk](http://escapetalk.nl). Their platform facilitates enthusiasts to track which games they've played and to review the best rooms. Their list of 'top escapers' shows some enthusiast have played over 150 in the past 6 years. Though most people will only have played a few.

What's clear is that people enjoy escape rooms, and some enjoy them _a lot_. Escape room designers and game masters have to consider a huge range of experience levels. The gap between casual players and enthusiasts is big, as is the reason people play. What draws these people to escape rooms differ, fortunately there has been extensive research on that. Likely, _because_ of that.

## Elements of an Escape Room

The yearly reoccurring survey _Escape Room Enthusiast Survey_ <Citation id="" /> has ranked the importance of several elements within escape rooms. In 2019, the three factors considered most essential by enthusiasts are:

1. Well designed puzzles and game flow
2. Novelty & Uniqueness
3. Immersion

These elements overlap and are interdependent on each other to be executed well. In short, immersion is highly dependent on the challenge proposed. Well-designed puzzles and game flow are a pre-requisite to high immersion. We'll dive deeper into their relationship later.
