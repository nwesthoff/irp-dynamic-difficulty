## Immersion

Generally speaking, one of the major goals of Escape Rooms is providing an escape from reality. To be truly immersed in the world that is created and forget about everything outside <Citation id="sugar_2019_the" />.

The term _total immersion_ is often interchangeably used with the concept of _spatial presence_; a state wherein we are wholly consumed by feelings of empathy and atmosphere. Ermi and Mäyrä categorise immersion in (video) games in three different types <Citation id="nacke_2008_flow" />.

- **Sensory** — audiovisual execution
- **Imaginative** — absorption in the narrative
- **Challenge-Based** — emergent gameplay experience

At _Up the Game 2018_, Liz Cable <Citation id="" hideAuthor /> speaks about physical, emotional and intellectual immersion. Her descriptions of these types of immersion relate closely to the subdivisions established through research in video games. These subdivisions seem to translate well to the physical spaces of Escape Rooms. Furthermore, Cable's Intellectual Immersion, as well as Ermi and Mäyrä's challenge-based immersion point towards the psychological theory of Flow. Offering a cognitively demanding, though achievable, experience seems to be a major key to success in games and escape rooms alike.

## The Compulsion Loop

Nick Moran describes in his talk _Tools of Immersion_, how successfully implementing the compulsion loop leads players from one challenge to the next <Citation id="" />.

- Desire → obstacle → reward → Repeat
- Powerful loop, people are lost when they don't know what they have to do next

The compulsion loop is linked to the overjustification effect → a reward is offered so players are driven by the promise of that reward, what happens when that reward disappears?

- For many, escape rooms are intrinsically motivating, so why do we really need that structure?

Errol Elumir <Citation id="" hideAuthor />, expands on the same principle from a different perspective. The gameplay loop seen most commonly in Escape Rooms usually chaotic, and rarely entirely linear. As escape room designers we can

1. Identify Gates
2. Collect Clues
3. Select gate to work on
4. Solve puzzle
   a. Aha Type
   b. Process Type
5. Input answer
6. Repeat

## Puzzles

The anatomy of a (good) puzzle is complex. If puzzles would all follow the same basic formula, they likely wouldn't be a puzzle anymore, since they're predictable. Though there are also factors _every_ good puzzle should do well. In my talks with Victor, I learned about _'Designing the Puzzle'_ <Citation id="bates_1997_designing" />. Written by Bob Bates in 1997, this isn't current by any stretch of the imagination, but it has been the underpinning for many of game designers' theories.

According to Bates, good puzzles contribute to _plot_, _character_ and _story development._ They draw the player into the fictional world. Good puzzles are fair and make sense, they exist to be fun, not to prevent players from finishing. Bad puzzles are _intrusive_ and _obstructionist_. They exists solely to frustrate players, and to make the designer look smart.

### Fair Puzzles

As escape room designers we should have the ambition to create a fair and enjoyable puzzle, Errol Elumir argues <Citation id="" hideAuthor />. Players shouldn't have to guess what the designer thought while creating it.

## Motivation

The first question one might ask is, why even play escape rooms in the first place? In _The Art of Game Design_ <Citation id=""/>_,_ the chapter _'The Player's Mind is Driven by the Player's Motivation'_ outlines how human motivation applies to game design. Maslow's _'A Theory of Human Motivation'_ provides an interesting lens to analyse the different activities that games offer. Schell notes that the popularity of games with online communities makes a lot of sense according to Maslow's theories.

### Self-determination theory

Beyond physical, humans have mental needs as well. According to Ryan and Deci they are:

1. **Competence** — I need to feel good at something
2. **Autonomy** — I need freedom to do things my own way
3. **Relatedness** — I need to connect with other people

Schell states it's hard to overlook how well games tend to fulfil all three of these needs.

## The Overjustification effect

When a reward is attached to a task we already find intrinsically motivating, we become less interested in the task after receiving the reward <Citation id="" />.

- Extrinsic motivation (receiving a reward)
- Intrinsic motivation (because we find a task enjoyable)

Schell lists several theories that blur the lines between extrinsic, and intrinsic motivation <Citation id="" hideAuthor />.
