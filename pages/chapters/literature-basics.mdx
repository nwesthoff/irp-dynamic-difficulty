## A Metamorphosis

Like most young product markets, escape rooms as we know them have changed a lot in these first few years. Over time, the rigid definition of escape rooms has been stretched and bent out of shape. No longer are they simply rooms to break out of. They have completely flipped the idea of what an escape room is on its head. They have stuck with their name, but escaped its original meaning in various ways. The escape room industry has fostered a scene of creatives, making all sorts of immersive live-experiences.

### Innovating on gameplay

Sherlocked's 'escape room' _The Vault_ was one of the first to do a _break-in_ experience well.

### Transformed focus

Victor notes they have become an umbrella term for entertainment featuring cinematic adventures, dedicated to originality, narrative and immersion.

> We’re part of a revolution in live entertainment, by showing customers that their lives, for an hour at a time, can be like a movie.
>
> - Victor van Doorn

Rachel Sugar writes escape rooms are no longer are a room to escape from, but an experience that offers a temporary escape from normal life <Citation id="sugar_2019_the" />.

As a result of these developments, players have come to expect more and more from escape rooms. If you consider an escape room experience as a transaction, players pay not only with money. They pay with their complete focus for a set amount of time as well. In return, they expect a good experience. That's why my first research question aims to uncover what game designers have to think about when they want to create a good escape room experience.

# What makes or breaks an escape room experience?

As discussed before, escape rooms come in many types, focus the player's attention on different aspects and are built around various themes. Players usually have to ‘escape’ a room filled with challenges within a given time limit. In some cases those challenges don't ask much from the player beyond moving from space to space. Generally however, escape rooms are at the core driven by puzzles. Which is the first part of escape rooms we'll look into.

## Puzzles

The anatomy of a (good) puzzle is complex. If puzzles would all follow the same basic formula, they likely wouldn't be a puzzle anymore, since that would make them predictable. Puzzles can take various forms and styles, to be decided on by the designer. Though there are also factors _every_ puzzle is made up of. The following theory applies to _'escape room'-style_ puzzles only, and may not be applicable to other types of puzzles (like sudoku's, jigsaw puzzles and crossword puzzles).

Wiemker, Elumir & Clare define that at the heart of every puzzle is a:

1. **Challenge** — a locked box
2. **Solution** — a combination
3. **Reward** — the contents of the box

![/img/puzzle-composition.png](/img/puzzle-composition.png "Wiemker, Elumir & Clare's basic puzzle composition")

This is a repeating pattern, a (potentially infinite) loop of challenges. Each reward holds the key to the next challenge <Citation id="wiemker,-elumir-and-clare_2015_escape" />.

### Designing Puzzles

According to Bob Bates <Citation id="bates_1997_designing" hideAuthor />, puzzles are at the heart of (adventure) games. Good puzzles contribute to _plot_, _character_ and _story development._ While these characteristics say nothing about the interaction on its own, they are crucial to nail the experience as a whole. Because the puzzles that do this well draw the player into the fictional world, make them care about solving the puzzle. Good puzzles are fair and make sense, they exist to be fun, not to prevent players from finishing. Contrarily, bad puzzles are _intrusive_ and _obstructionist_. These puzzles only frustrate players and aim to make the designer look smart.

### Fair Puzzles

Escape room designers should pay extra attention to create fair and enjoyable puzzles. What makes this especially true for escape rooms is that they are bound by a set time limit. Getting stuck wastes time and hurts in two ways. Primarily, it frustrates players in that moment, on top it also cuts on time that's left for a good experience.

Errol Elumir argues in favour of this as well. He says, that as escape room designers we should have the ambition to make puzzles that are to be solved with only the information in that room <Citation id="elumir_2018_13" hideAuthor />. He doesn't see players as adversaries, and as a designer, he's on their side. We should not trick people, we should not mislead them. Designing puzzles is not about putting in roadblocks to ensure a humbling defeat. Ultimately, designers shouldn't set out to prove they are smarter than the player. He writes:

> As a designer, I want people to solve my puzzles. I take no delight in people’s failure
>
> - Errol Elumir <Citation id="elumir_2018_13" hideAuthor />

Elumir explains that this does not mean all puzzles have to be easy to solve. A puzzle can be difficult and enjoyable at the same time. Players will embrace difficulty, and don’t mind failing so long as failure feels fair to them. When playing escape rooms, players expect to rely solely on their wits and each other. When this expectation isn't granted, bad puzzles (and bad escape rooms) are the result. Bates writes a common player response in a situation like that is: “There is no way I could ever have solved that. I don’t even understand it now!”. Even 20 years later, a common error is that players have to guess what the designer thought while creating a puzzle, Elumir notes.

### Puzzle difficulty

It should be obvious that designing extremely hard puzzles shouldn't be the primary goal. However, when we do want to increase or decrease difficulty to cater to different players, there are several (metaphorical) dials to turn. In _Designing the Puzzle_, Bob Bates argues designing difficulty is actually one of the easiest parts of puzzle design <Citation id="bates_1997_designing" />. He provides the following:

1. **Breadcrumbs —** Change the amount or directness of information to players
2. **Alternate solutions —** Adding alternate solutions make a puzzle easier
3. **Steps to solve —** Increasing the steps to solve a puzzle increases the difficulty
4. **Proximity —** The closer (physiologically and geographically) the solution, the easier
5. **Steering the Player —** nudging in the right direction, as a response to player actions

Furthermore, he writes puzzle designers should develop player empathy. The ability to put ourselves into the player's shoes. Bates establishes that this is a key skill to determine whether a puzzle is "fair and reasonable". It allows us to consider what situation a player is in, whether they know what they should solve, and what the blocking obstacles are to resolve. While Bates does emphasise the importance of empathy this is also where this article starts to show its age. As a user experience designer, actually testing a proposed design solution is at the core of my work.

### Balancing difficulty

What Bates calls 'player empathy' is now a much more profound part of the process of puzzle design. Rita Orlov <Citation id="orlov_2018_balancing" hideAuthor /> describes how puzzle difficulty is a balancing act. She says, regardless of the targeted difficulty level of an experience, it's important to be aware _why_ players are unable to solve a puzzle. Whether they fail because something is confusing or obtuse, instead of their inability to make a logic leap.

We gain that ability best through rigorous testing, by which we're able to continuously shave on the experience. In escape room design this can be done through several ways, Rita Orlov <Citation id="orlov_2020_puzzle" hideAuthor /> explains she tests several factors. Puzzles may break in several ways, including whether clueing is direct enough, if it's possible to solve with the information players have and because of issues in the physical context it is set in. Testing all these factors with real players and understanding what happened makes the game more fun.

### The Compulsion Loop

As I alluded to before, puzzles aren't self-contained interactions that players have. They are part of the entire escape room 'system'. Escape rooms host a repeating pattern of varying interactions, that connect through their input and output. Nick Moran describes in his talk _Tools of Immersion_, how to ensure players know what to do, by successfully implementing the compulsion loop <Citation id="moran_2017_tools" />.

1. **Desire** — each puzzle starts with a desire. The need to go somewhere, or get something.
2. **Obstacle** — this desire is blocked by a certain obstacle. The puzzle is removing that obstacle.
3. **Reward** — upon unblocking the obstacle, players receive a reward. Which should point towards the next desire.
4. **Repeat** — by repeating this loop, players know what to do next.

![/img/compulsion-loop.png](/img/compulsion-loop.png)

The repetition leads players from one challenge to the next, and each reward shows players what _desire_ to care about next. When this isn't clear, people are lost and they lose interest. Clearly, maintaining the compulsion loop is essential to ensure players enjoy the escape room as a whole.

### **Puzzle paths**

This is obviously a simplified way of looking at things. The distribution and placement of puzzles plays an important role in any escape room. The gameplay loop is rarely entirely linear, and in most cases might even seem chaotic. The approaches most commonly seen incorporate the compulsion loop in some way. Heikkinen & Shumeyko <Citation id="heikkinen-and-shumeyko_2016_designing" hideAuthor /> identify three:

:::

::: section wide-width
![/img/puzzle-path-types.png](/img/puzzle-path-types.png)
:::

::: section small-width

- **Sequential** — this is a mostly (or entirely) linear experience. Each puzzle only leads into a single new puzzle.
  - Pros: Easiest to follow (strong effect of compulsion loop). Most control over progression of difficulty.
  - cons: allows for _no_ parallelisation. The team has to work on each challenge as a whole, whether they're with two or 8. Quickly becomes tedious or boring.
- **Path based** — multiple paths of puzzles are available at the same time. These paths often lead to a single, final puzzle. The _meta_ puzzle.
  - Pros: Allows team-work and parallelisation, allowing for bigger groups to play the escape room. When the meta-puzzle clearly shows what paths have not been completed, players still know what to do next.
  - Cons: it's easy to distract players. To confuse them.
- **Open** — all puzzles are separate, and stand on their own to escape the room.
  - Pros: Allows for lots of parallel puzzle solving. Everyone is able to work on something individually.
  - cons: Individual experience. Confuses players (no compulsion loop to motivate next moves). Hard to control progression of difficulty.

### Gameplay loop

Essentially, what the compulsion loop and puzzle paths have in common is that they describe a gameplay loop. A repeating pattern of varying activities, that lead into one or more successive activities. Errol Elumir <Citation id="elumir_2019b_how" hideAuthor />, looks at designing escape rooms from that perspective. He lists several activities players likely will come across.

1. Identify Gates
2. Collect Clues
3. Select gate to work on
4. Solve puzzle

   a. Aha Type

   b. Process Type

5. Input answer
6. Repeat

## Immersion

As Rachel Sugar explains, one goal of Escape Rooms is to immerse the player in a story, set in another world. They make you temporarily forget about work, your phone, and everything else going on in life. Escape rooms' promise is a temporary escape from reality <Citation id="sugar_2019_the" />. Highly immersive experiences are about creating a world that never ends. This brings out the maximum emotional response in players <Citation id="moran_2017_tools" />.

This is also an obvious business goal, as people who are immersed in media also tend to enjoy it more <Citation id="madigan_2010_psychology" />. Which turns into chatter advocating for a good experience with friends, and strangers.

> To be truly immersed in the world that is created and forget about everything outside
>
> - Rachel Sugar <Citation id="sugar_2019_the" hideAuthor />.

### Types of immersion

To achieve an escape from reality, and become immersed in a fictitious world, we should understand what that actually means. Unfortunately, the definition of immersion isn't clearly established, and the true cause of immersion is still something we can't quite put our finger on.

> Clear and testable definitions of constructs such as immersion and flow would be invaluable.
>
> - Nacke & Lindley <Citation id="nacke_2008_flow" hideAuthor />

A variety of explanations, overlapping theories and opinions are discussed within the realm of the psychology of games. The term _total immersion_ is often interchangeably used with the concept of _spatial presence_; a state wherein we are wholly consumed by feelings of empathy and atmosphere. Lennart Nacke and Craig Lindley explain how Ermi and Mäyrä have categorised the types of immersion typically found in video games <Citation id="nacke_2008_flow" />.

- **Sensory** — audiovisual execution
- **Imaginative** — absorption in the narrative
- **Challenge-Based** — emergent gameplay experience

While this might not be a conclusive list, Ermi and Mäyrä cover a range of qualities that cause immersion. At _Up the Game 2018_, Liz Cable <Citation id="cable_2018_escape" hideAuthor /> speaks about _physical_, _emotional_ and _intellectual_ immersion. Her descriptions of these types of immersion relate closely to sensory, imaginative and challenge-based immersion respectively. Indeed, these theoretical factors seem to translate well to the physical spaces of Escape Rooms as well. In the next section, we'll discuss how escape rooms attempt to fulfil these qualities. We'll also go over which areas escape rooms excel at, and where they lack compared to other mediums.

### Sensory

The audiovisual execution of escape rooms have improved enormously since its earlier days. Sensory immersion is the result of effectively stimulating as many of our senses as possible. Considering primarily what we _feel_, _see_ and _hear_, though some escape rooms have started targeting what we _smell_ and _taste_ as well.

### Imaginative

Imaginative immersion considers the narrative component of an experience. The importance of narrative in escape rooms has been an ongoing discussion. Some players are perfectly fine with a thin narrative, whereas primarily come to an escape room to explore an interesting story. There are several variables to choose from while creating the narrative like _genre_, _setting_ and the _world_ it's in. <Citation id="nicholson_2016_ask" hideAuthor />.

In escape games there are three touchpoints with the narrative:

- **Story** — the spoken or written part of the story
- **Space** — the environment telling part of the story
- **Puzzles** — progressing the story by interacting with it

### Challenge-based

Fortunately, escape rooms **excel** at one thing; offering challenging puzzles to draw the player in. They make the player an active component in their own experience, unlike watching a movie at the cinema, for example. While a great story adds to a great experience, even escape rooms with poor narrative execution get people drawn in. Escape rooms, good or bad, put the player front-and-center by definition. They have players exploring, observing and actively participate in the scene <Citation id="cooper_2017_hard" />.

### Flow

We can't talk about challenge-based immersion without discussing the psychological theory of _flow_, a well established concept in psychology. Flow, introduced by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi <Citation id="csikszentmihalyi_2008_flow" />, is defined as an optimal experience; a challenging activity that requires skill. One in which we perform at our highest abilities. Activities that put us in a state of flow are goal-directed and bounded by rules. Meaning we know what to do, and how to get there. When a state of flow is reached, it _completely consumes_ what we're doing and _makes time pass_ without us noticing. Csikszentmihalyi <Citation id="snyder_2005_handbook" hideAuthor /> determined flow occurs in an individual when a set of specific conditions are met:

1. Clear goals and immediate feedback
2. Continuously challenging

Clear goals allow us to more easily stay focused on a task. Immediate feedback on our progress towards the next goal(s) keeps the ball rolling. We're able to more effectively determine the next step, since we don't have to wait to know the effect a previous action caused.

Human beings love a challenge. Continuously engaging in challenges that are appropriate to one's capacities causes flow, so long as it's a challenge we think we can achieve. In the context of escape rooms, well-designed puzzles and game flow are a pre-requisite to high levels of immersion.

Keeping players in a state of flow channel is a delicate balance. Players start a game at different levels of skill, their skill level changes through time and it's hard to know whether they are _currently_ experiencing flow in the first place. Game designers try to achieve this state of being by carefully designing when emotional beats land, high-pressure challenges occur and allow for the player to cool down as well. This creates an almost rhythmic movement of experience <Citation id="schell_2019_the" />.

> The cycle of tense and release, tense and release seems to be inherent to human enjoyment
>
> - Jesse Schell <Citation id="schell_2019_the" hideAuthor />

### Attention span

That cycle of tension and release is something Tommy Honton <Citation id="constructedadventures_2020_interview" hideAuthor /> talks about in an interview with _Constructed Adventures_ as well. Coming from a background in film and tv, he notes that they have complete control of speed a story unravels. He says feature films and tv shows have nailed how to keep people's attention. Because people don't have agency over a film, directors have complete control of the pacing of emotional low and high points.

Escape rooms give players a lot of control over the way they play, and as a result game designers lose the strict control over pacing other mediums enjoy. He mentions people have a limited attention span. When players take a longer than that to solve a puzzle they need a break. When they don't their optimal experience fades.

> You can get people to focus for 5-6 minutes max before they need a break mentally. If they solve it [a puzzle], you buy back a little bit of time because of dopamine.
>
> - Tommy Honton <Citation id="constructedadventures_2020_interview" hideAuthor />

### Recognising flow

It is hard to measure flow, since the act of asking a person whether they are experiencing it, immediately takes them out of that experience <Citation id="emerson_1998_flow" />. Csikszentmihalyi does describe what people who experience flow say they felt like during that experience:

1. **Complete concentration** — focused on the present moment, unaware of factors beyond the current context
2. **Activity becomes spontaneous** — action and awareness merge, people know exactly what to do while recognising the next goal
3. **Loss of self-consciousness** — people experiencing flow become unaware of their self, they stop self-criticising
4. **Sense of control** — feeling capable to deal with the situation they are in, the feeling to know how to respond to what comes next
5. **Distorted view of time** — typically experiencing a loss of time, like it's passing faster than normal
6. **The task is the reward** — the activity is _intrinsically rewarding_, sometimes so much that the end goal is nothing more than an excuse to be able to do the act itself

Schell also describes some indicators of flow in the context of video games. He says while playing solo games, players are often quiet, possibly muttering to themselves. Interestingly, during multiplayer games, players will often communicate with one another with excitement. Though — like in single player games — they are still constantly focused solely on the game.

### Conflicts of immersion

Haley Cooper, originally focused her efforts on immersive theatre design. For a while she's been designing escape rooms as well. She might be _the_ best person to ask about making immersive escape games. She writes an immersive theatre escape room would be super hard to pull off. Since the primary requirements of immersive theatre (immersion and storytelling) conflict with the mechanics of an escape game.

She argues that, while escape rooms are certainly physically encompass the players, she needs a little more world building than most escape rooms seem to do.

> Most escape rooms feel like spaces designed for a game more than inhabited places. They often look a little empty. And there are good reasons for that…
>
> - Haley Cooper <Citation id="cooper_2017_hard" hideAuthor />

That's the big difference between real spaces, that people actually live in, and an escape room. Escape rooms tend to feel like an empty husk. It is actually what Nicholson advocates for, to ask "Why is this here?" in his essay "Ask Why". An often lauded essay on escape room design <Citation id="nicholson_2016_ask" hideAuthor />. As a result, escape rooms have more in common with something you would see in the photos of an architecture portfolio, than the workspace of someone like Nikola Tesla. Each object in an escape room has its purpose, and is heavily curated. Each object has to have a purpose within the _world_, _setting_ and _genre's expectations_.

<SideBySide>

![living-room](/img/living-room.jpg "A modern, well-lit interior, limited amount of items on display")
![workspace](/img/workspace.jpg "A wood-working space littered with materials and tools")

</SideBySide>

Clearly, escape rooms offer a limited amount of intractable objects for a reason. If the escape room would be in the workshop, a significant portion of the allotted time would be spent on identifying the puzzles, instead of solving them. While the modern interior certainly has a less interesting story to tell, it would make for a better escape room environment. There is less clutter to be confused about. Of course these are extreme examples, but they illustrate Cooper's point well. The mechanics of an escape game directly contradict those of narratively immersive experiences.

Purely from a theoretical point of view, immersion and escape rooms don't get along. Simultaneously however, it is clear that narrative immersion is as important to escape rooms as the challenge they present. The main benefit of merging those two worlds would be to allow them both to occur at the same time. For that reason it is important to investigate how escape games can offer clear (proximal) goals, while delivering a compelling story.

## Cohesion

Scott Nicholson, a Professor of Game Design and Development at Wilfrid Laurier University. With his paper *"Ask Why", h*e pleads for the consistency of escape games, based on knowledge from the video game industry. He says video games have seen a debate between Narratologists, who argued that games's primary focus is storytelling and Ludologists. The latter focusing on games as a set of mechanisms and inviting play. Within this context, the debate has moved focus to better integrate the two <Citation id="nicholson_2016_ask" />. Nicholson argues one solution has been to put 'the experience' first, but describes it as some imaginary goal. As an experience designer, I subscribe to Peter Benz's definition of an experience <Citation id="benz_2015_experience" />. It develops where a variety of objects, interactions, spaces and information come together. In that regard, it's something that grows, not something that can be forced.

Fortunately, Nicholson makes up by example <Citation id="nicholson_2016_ask" hideAuthor />. He cites the concept of _Narrative Architecture_, which is commonly used by the theme park industry to create immersive experiences. Its goal is to embed game mechanisms (challenges, puzzles, etc.) in a larger world. Instead using a story as a shiny coat of paint, the story is woven into the space players explore. Within the realm of (escape) games, the narrative as such, will only progress as players clear challenges. They provide touch points

We've already established this isn't an easy problem to solve due to the nature of escape rooms. However, Nicholson provides a strategy to achieve a consistent narrative architecture. He writes escape room designers should ask _why_ continuously, as they design an experience. He argues each puzzle, task and item should be there for a reason. And that it should be consistent with the the red thread throughout the room.

### The language of puzzles

Mark Brown <Citation id="gamemakerstoolkit_2016_how" hideAuthor /> explains how Jonathan Blow, a well-regarded indie-game developer, designs puzzles. His approach makes , since it has several results on the final interaction.

<div>

<AlternatingImageBlock
  src="/img/blow-puzzle-1.png"
  title="Mechanic"
  desc="Jonathan Blow starts with a game mechanic. In The Witness everything is built
      around mazes."
/>

<AlternatingImageBlock
  src="/img/blow-puzzle-2.png"
  title="Rules"
  desc="He then actually build the puzzle. By playing with these basic puzzles, rules
      emerge. In The Witness, you have to separate colours."
/>

<AlternatingImageBlock
  src="/img/blow-puzzle-3.png"
  title="Consequences"
  desc="By building these rules, new consequences arise. In The Witness that might be
      blocking the most obvious exit."
/>

<AlternatingImageBlock
  src="/img/blow-puzzle-4.png"
  title="Mechanic"
  desc="Every puzzle illustrates a consequence you have to internalise. In The Witness
      you have to realise you're blocking that primary exit by offering an alternative
      exit."
/>
</div>

This is an interesting design philosophy, because puzzles build on each other as a result of the process they were designed with. They were designed by playing with them, like a player would.

> There's an extent to which this game designed itself.
>
> - Jonathan Blow <Citation id="gamemakerstoolkit_2016_how" hideAuthor />

By adding constraints, the puzzles have a natural progression to them. The result is that players can start to understand the _'language'_ of these puzzles. They will learn how the designer created these puzzles, because they follow a designers' footsteps.

### Spatial Situation Model

On a super scientific level, we find an explanation as to why escape rooms excel at sensory immersion. From the perspective of video games, Wirth et al. explain the formation of spatial presence (aka total immersion) as a two-step mental process <Citation id="wirth_2007_a" hideAuthor />. Simply put:

1. The mind starts to establish a mental representation of the space or world that is portrayed, and what kind of place it is.
2. Slowly it starts to prefer the new space as its point of reference. It establishes whether it, the mind itself, is located within said place. The _primary ego reference frame_ changes.

They define that the spatial situation model (SSM) is a precondition to the occurrence of spatial presence.

Immersion is a complex quality to discuss, as the three types of immersion are highly interconnected. In some ways they strengthen each other, but simultaneously oppose each other in other ways. It's impossible to discuss immersion in a vacuum, and the best way to look at it is as an umbrella term for everything an escape room has to do well. The _puzzles_, _theme_, _location_, _story_ and almost everything else escape rooms have to offer share a piece of the immersion pie. If you look at it like that, one could argue immersion is _the most_ important quality of escape rooms, its _raison d’être_.

# How does the experience of enthusiasts differ from other players?

Now we have a pretty good understanding of the inner workings of an escape room, we can move on to understand _why_ people enjoy playing them. What causes people to want to experience escape rooms and how does that change for escape room enthusiasts?

## Motivation for play

Escape room experiences are appealing through _intrinsic motivation_, which means we are motivated to play them because we find it enjoyable. On the opposite, extrinsic motivation means we are motivated by an external incentive (like a reward) <Citation id="gamemakerstoolkit_2020_the" hideAuthor />.

### Flow is autotelic

People's enjoyment of escape rooms might be (partially) explained by the fact that flow is _autotelic._ Meaning it's enjoyable doing for it's own sake. Activities that cause flow are self-rewarding and pleasurable to do, because feeling flow cultivates intrinsic motivation <Citation id="kapitein_2020_invisible" />. It enables personal growth by being constantly challenging. Flow occurs when the conditions are such that they make us think _"I never thought I could do that"_.

### Personal Flow Zones

The first hints at the heart of our problem comes courtesy of an article by Jenova Chen <Citation id="chen_2007_flow" hideAuthor />, which describes _Personal Flow Zones._ Not every person starts developing a skill (such as escaping escape rooms) with the same abilities. And certainly not every person develops those skills at the same rate. Chen describes how designers adapt the flow experience by deliberately building choice into an experience.

<SideBySide>

![/img/chen-flow.png](/img/chen-flow.png)
![/img/chen-flow-choice.png](/img/chen-flow-choice.png)

</SideBySide>

When an experience doesn't fit within a certain players' flow zone, one of the most important factors of immersion — challenge-based immersion — diminishes. In that situation flow doesn't occur, and the experience might very well lose the characteristics required to foster intrinsic motivation.

### The overjustification effect

Mark Brown, from _Game Maker's Toolkit_, motivates why it's so important to know what motivates players to play a game. His main argument is the result of the _overjustification effect_. It describes that the presence of a reward makes intrinsically motivating activities less interesting. We become less interested in the task after receiving the reward <Citation id="gamemakerstoolkit_2020_the" hideAuthor />.

In 1973, a study asked three groups of children to draw a picture.

1. The first group is promised a reward. This group showed much less interest in drawing afterward receiving the reward, and their drawings were of lower quality too.
2. The second group did not get a reward. They enjoyed the process of drawing and do not miss the reward. They are intrinsically motivated to finish the activity.
3. Some were given a surprise reward. They spent more time drawing than the previous two groups

![/img/overjustification-effect.png](/img/overjustification-effect.png)

A few side-effects of the overjustification effect are decreased creativity, decreased problem solving performance, prone to cheating and losing motivation entirely after receiving a reward.

Mark Brown does have a fairly black-and-white perspective on this issue. Contrarily, Jesse Schell discusses several theories that show how the lines between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation blur when applied to the context of gaming <Citation id="schell_2019_the" hideAuthor />.

> Savvy designers know that one motivation can grow on another, like a vine growing on a trellis
>
> - Jesse Schell <Citation id="schell_2019_the" hideAuthor />

He views the complexity of intrinsic and extrinsic as a continuous gradient, something that is far less binary than Mark Brown sees it. With more nuance, he describes the same study. He reasons that external motivation is something that is sometimes added to intrinsic motivation. In other cases the interplay of motivation causes the previous intrinsic motivation to disappear.

![/img/motivation-table.png](/img/motivation-table.png)

Balancing motivation, and considering how they influence the player is especially difficult for escape rooms. The key difference in this case, is its fixed time limit. On one hand, we don't want players to rush through the game. To constantly trigger them with a reward, and take away any and all exploration by telling them exactly what to do. On the other, we don't want them to feel lost during their play. It's important that players feel like it's a fair experience, one they could have escaped in the set time.

Why even play escape rooms in the first place? In _The Art of Game Design_ <Citation id="schell_2019_the"/>_,_ the chapter _'The Player's Mind is Driven by the Player's Motivation'_ outlines how human motivation applies to game design. Maslow's _'A Theory of Human Motivation'_ provides an interesting lens to analyse the different activities that games offer. Schell notes that the popularity of games with online communities makes a lot of sense according to Maslow's theories.

![/img/maslow.png](/img/maslow.png 'Maslow's Theory of Human Motivation')

### Self-determination theory

Beyond physical, humans have mental needs as well. Self-determination theory views people as active contributors of their behaviour. They are the "authors" of their own story. Self-determination explains the need for a sense of personal empowerment, involving both _knowing_ and _having_ what it takes to achieve goals. According to Deci and Ryan <Citation id="deci_2010_selfdetermination" hideAuthor /> self-determination maintains that all people have three basic psychological needs:

1. **Competence** — I need to feel good at something
2. **Autonomy** — I need freedom to do things my own way
3. **Relatedness** — I need to connect with other people

Schell <Citation id="schell_2019_the" hideAuthor /> states it's hard to overlook how well games tend to fulfil all three of these needs.

# How might we alter escape games based on players?

Previously, we examined the parts every escape room has to do well. And we have established a theoretical understanding of the way players think. To understand what experience players desire, and how we should tailor the experience to them, we have to understand how they feel during play.

## Measuring the Player's Gameplay Experience

There have been several attempts at online measurement of a players' gameplay experience. That is, measuring it _while_ they play, in real-time.

### Physiological measurement

One of such attempts to measure immersion and flow is done by Nacke & Lindley <Citation id="nacke_2008_flow" hideAuthor />. They measure the emotional state of their test subjects, while playing modified levels of Half-Life 2 (a first-person shooter). They grade the experience on two axes.

- Electromyography (EMG) to determine valence, a strong indicator of the _good_-ness of an experience.
- Galvanic Skin Response (GVR) commonly used as an indicator for arousal (how passionate we are about an experience)

Their study suggests that game levels scoring high on flow, show increased values for valence as well as arousal.

### What is Emotion?

To understand how people feel it's key to know how emotion works. Unfortunately, the scientific community has not seen eye-to-eye in this regard. Generally speaking there are three major lines of thinking; Basic Emotional Theory, Appraisal Theory and the Theory of Constructed Emotion. The last one of those, a fairly recent development, flips our common line of thinking about emotion on its head.

### Variability

If Lisa Feldman Barrett is to be believed, both _physiological changes_ in our bodies and _facial expressions_ aren't a reliable way to estimate how people feel. Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett explains how emotions are not caused by physiological changes in our body. Emotions are in fact a result of the physiological changes in our body, and how our brains makes them _feel_ important to us <Citation id="feldman-barrett_2020_how" />.

> Your emotions are not your reactions to the world. They are your constructions or more precisely, what your bodily sensations mean in a specific context or situation that you are in.
>
> - Lisa Feldman Barrett <Citation id="feldman-barrett_2020_how" hideAuthor />

It turns out that the western idea of universal expressions of emotion are not so universal after all. While some people certainly scowl when they are angry, not everyone does. At the same time, many people who scowl are not angry.

> People move their face in very different ways during instances of the same emotion category. They also move their faces in exactly the same way in instances of different emotion categories.
>
> - Lisa Feldman Barrett <Citation id="feldman-barrett_2020_how" hideAuthor />

Assuming we display emotion using universal facial expressions suffers from the same problems as assuming everyone entering an escape room has the same level of experience. This way of thinking only takes into account a small portion of people.

To make matters worse, physiological measurements suffer from a similar problem. When an increased heart rate feels like anxiety, that is because your brains categorizes it as such. They make a concept that fits with the physiological changes in your body. As a result, it's incredibly hard to 'measure emotion'. Emotions are dependent of context, and part of that context is the body we take into the room.

All of this might be explained by the definition of experience. As I've argued before, experiences are not self-contained. They occur in a larger context and are highly personal. They are influenced not only by what we feel, see or hear at that time, but also the memories we take into an escape room <Citation id="" />. Since escape rooms are (generally) multi-user experiences, it makes sense to divert our efforts to examine the escape team as a whole. How do they communicate? What do they talk about, and what don't they talk about?

## Team Performance

Marlow et al. <Citation id="" hideAuthor /> conducted a meta-analysis of team communication. They argue that teams that are more familiar with each-other, communicate less frequently, but communication quality increased. Familiar teams share information that is less redundant, and as such communication efficiency increases. Furthermore, they determined good communication is more important to familiar teams than non-familiar teams.

> As team familiarity increases, team members become more adept at locating expertise among team members, reducing the frequency by which team members communicate and increasing efficiency

### Group Flow

Like Csikszentmihalyi, Sawyer studied the concept of flow. However, he focused how this applies to groups <Citation id="sawyer_2008_group" />. He outlines the ideal conditions for *group flow* to emerge as:

1. **Group goals** —
2. **Close listening** —
3. **Complete concentration** —
4. **Being in contro**l —
5. **Blending egos** —
6. **Equal participation** —
7. **Knowing team mates** —
8. **Good communication** —
9. **Being progress-oriented** —

People experience flow most commonly when in conversation with others, Csikszentmihalyi found. When this occurs, statements are genuine, and unplanned responses to what we hear. Consequently, *group flow* is more likely to emerge when everyone is fully engaged.

### Four Keys to Fun

Nicole Lazarro <Citation id="lazarro_2004_why" hideAuthor /> has studied players' emotions before, during and after play. Through facial gestures, body language and verbal comments they identified four keys to create emotion without story cutscenes.

1. **Hard Fun** — The enjoyment of challenge and progress
2. **Easy Fun** — The enjoyment of being immersed in a game
3. **Altered States** — The enjoyment of changes in internal state
4. **People Factor** — The enjoyment of playing with others

Interestingly, the 2004 study doesn't describe any reactive system. I expect this is due to its age, and Lazarro seems to have aimed her sights on it more recently.

In her talk _Four Keys to Fun: Using Emotions to Create Engaging Design_ at AIGA Design <Citation id="lazarro_2016_games" />, she describes how game design and human centered design relate. She explains how we as designers can react to people's emotions.

> These systems identify... they might be able to read your emotions that you're feeling and make adjustments according to that. Or you might as the user choose an emotion. I need to feel more creative, so these are the emotions I feel.
