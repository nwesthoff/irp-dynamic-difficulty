## Elements of an Escape Room

The _2019 Escape Room Enthusiast Survey_ <Citation id="" /> has ranked the importance of several elements within escape rooms. The three factors rising to the top are:

1. Well designed puzzles and game flow
2. Novelty & Uniqueness
3. Immersion

These elements have a lot of overlap, and in this chapter we'll learn how these are interconnected and influence each-other.

## Puzzles

Good puzzles contribute to _plot_, _character_ and _story development_, they draw the player into the fictional world. Bad puzzles are intrusive and obstructionist. They exists solely to frustrate players, and to make the designer look smart <Citation id="bates_1997_designing" />.

### Fair Puzzles

As escape room designers we should have the ambition to create a fair and enjoyable puzzle, Errol Elumir argues <Citation id="" hideAuthor />. Players shouldn't have to guess what the designer thought while creating it.

### Puzzle Difficulty

By now it should be obvious that designing extremely hard puzzles shouldn't be the primary goal. However, when we do want to increase or decrease difficulty to cater to different players, there are several (metaphorical) dials to turn. In _Designing the Puzzle_, Bob Bates argues that's one of the easiest parts of puzzle design <Citation id="" />.

1. **Breadcrumbs —** Change the amount or directness of information to players
2. **Alternate solutions —** Adding alternate solutions make a puzzle easier
3. **Steps to solve —** Increasing the steps to solve a puzzle increases the difficulty
4. **Proximity —** The closer (physiologically and geographically) the solution, the easier
5. **Steering the Player —** nudging in the right direction, as a response to player actions

It's also important to be aware of some traps. Elumir thinks many escape rooms make the same errors when they try to increase difficulty <Citation id="" hideAuthor />. He describes five:

1. Identifying gates and collecting clues should be straightforward
2. It should be obvious which puzzles to work on
3. Revelatory puzzles are hard to do well, adding too many shuts out mainstream players
4. Don't add tedium to slow players down, ex. unscrewing lots of screws instead of few
5. Don't make it difficult to enter a combination

## The Compulsion Loop

Nick Moran describes in his talk _Tools of Immersion_, how successfully implementing the compulsion loop leads players from one challenge to the next <Citation id="" />.

- Desire → obstacle → reward → Repeat
- Powerful loop, people are lost when they don't know what they have to do next

The compulsion loop is linked to the overjustification effect → a reward is offered so players are driven by the promise of that reward, what happens when that reward disappears?

- For many, escape rooms are intrinsically motivating, so why do we really need that structure?

Errol Elumir <Citation id="" hideAuthor />, expands on the same principle from a different perspective. The gameplay loop seen most commonly in Escape Rooms usually chaotic, and rarely entirely linear. As escape room designers we can

1. Identify Gates
2. Collect Clues
3. Select gate to work on
4. Solve puzzle
   a. Aha Type
   b. Process Type
5. Input answer
6. Repeat
