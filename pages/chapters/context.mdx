Designing for escape rooms, means it's important to know what makes them special. This chapter explores what escape rooms are, why people like playing them and what makes a good escape room.

## Rise of the escape room

Since 2014, the number of escape rooms has seen meteoric growth. Room Escape Artist manages a database of US escape rooms, that currently lists 2102 rooms (I suspect COVID-19 has caused a sharp decline this year), up from just 24 in 2014 <Citation id="" hideAuthor />.

![ltr: 24, 100, 900, 1850, 2300, 2350, 2250](/img/escape-rooms-us-2014-2020.png "Escape Room growth from 2014 to 2020")

For the past few years, the demand for escape rooms seems to have been able to sustain the increasing number of escape rooms. Though 2020 might show the first year this doesn't seem to be the case. Whether that trend continues after we've escaped the pandemic remains to be seen.

Looking on an individual level, we can see some people have enjoyed escape rooms extensively as well. Dutch website [Escapetalk](http://escapetalk.nl) lists 'top escapers', some having played over 150 in the past 6 years, while others have only played one or two <Citation id="" hideAuthor />. There's a huge range of experience.

What's clear is that people enjoy escape rooms, and some more than others. What draws these people to escape rooms differ, though there's been extensive research in that regard as well.

## Elements of an Escape Room

The yearly reoccurring survey _Escape Room Enthusiast Survey_ <Citation id="" /> has ranked the importance of several elements within escape rooms. In 2019, the three factors considered most essential by enthusiasts are:

1. Well designed puzzles and game flow
2. Novelty & Uniqueness
3. Immersion

These elements overlap and are interdependent on each other to be executed well. In short, immersion is highly dependent on the challenge proposed. Well-designed puzzles and game flow are a pre-requisite to high immersion. We'll dive deeper into their relationship later, but since well designed puzzles are important to many, we'll start there.

## Puzzles

The anatomy of a (good) puzzle is complex. If puzzles would all follow the same basic formula, they likely wouldn't be a puzzle anymore, since they're predictable. Though there are also factors _every_ good puzzle should do well. In my talks with Victor, I learned about _'Designing the Puzzle'_ <Citation id="bates_1997_designing" />. Written by Bob Bates in 1997, this isn't current by any stretch of the imagination, but it has been the underpinning for many of game designers' theories.

According to Bates, good puzzles contribute to _plot_, _character_ and _story development._ They draw the player into the fictional world. Good puzzles are fair and make sense, they exist to be fun, not to prevent players from finishing. Bad puzzles are _intrusive_ and _obstructionist_. They exists solely to frustrate players, and to make the designer look smart.

### Fair Puzzles

As escape room designers we should have the ambition to create a fair and enjoyable puzzle, Errol Elumir argues <Citation id="" hideAuthor />. Players shouldn't have to guess what the designer thought while creating it.

### Puzzle Difficulty

By now it should be obvious that designing extremely hard puzzles shouldn't be the primary goal. However, when we do want to increase or decrease difficulty to cater to different players, there are several (metaphorical) dials to turn. In _Designing the Puzzle_, Bob Bates argues that's one of the easiest parts of puzzle design <Citation id="" />.

1. **Breadcrumbs —** Change the amount or directness of information to players
2. **Alternate solutions —** Adding alternate solutions make a puzzle easier
3. **Steps to solve —** Increasing the steps to solve a puzzle increases the difficulty
4. **Proximity —** The closer (physiologically and geographically) the solution, the easier
5. **Steering the Player —** nudging in the right direction, as a response to player actions

It's also important to be aware of some traps. Elumir thinks many escape rooms make the same errors when they try to increase difficulty <Citation id="" hideAuthor />. He describes five:

1. Identifying gates and collecting clues should be straightforward
2. It should be obvious which puzzles to work on
3. Revelatory puzzles are hard to do well, adding too many shuts out mainstream players
4. Don't add tedium to slow players down, ex. unscrewing lots of screws instead of few
5. Don't make it difficult to enter a combination

## The Compulsion Loop

Nick Moran describes in his talk _Tools of Immersion_, how successfully implementing the compulsion loop leads players from one challenge to the next <Citation id="" />.

- Desire → obstacle → reward → Repeat
- Powerful loop, people are lost when they don't know what they have to do next

![/img/compulsion-loop.png](/img/compulsion-loop.png)

The compulsion loop is linked to the overjustification effect → a reward is offered so players are driven by the promise of that reward, what happens when that reward disappears?

- For many, escape rooms are intrinsically motivating, so why do we really need that structure?

Errol Elumir <Citation id="" hideAuthor />, expands on the same principle from a different perspective. The gameplay loop seen most commonly in Escape Rooms usually chaotic, and rarely entirely linear. As escape room designers we can

1. Identify Gates
2. Collect Clues
3. Select gate to work on
4. Solve puzzle

   a. Aha Type

   b. Process Type

5. Input answer
6. Repeat
