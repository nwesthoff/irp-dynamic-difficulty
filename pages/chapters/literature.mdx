## Individual

### Motivation

The first question one might ask is, why even play escape rooms in the first place? In _The Art of Game Design_ <Citation id=""/>_,_ the chapter _'The Player's Mind is Driven by the Player's Motivation'_ outlines how human motivation applies to game design. Maslow's _'A Theory of Human Motivation'_ provides an interesting lens to analyse the different activities that games offer. Schell notes that the popularity of games with online communities makes a lot of sense according to Maslow's theories.

#### Self-determination theory

Beyond physical, humans have mental needs as well. According to Ryan and Deci they are:

1. **Competence** — I need to feel good at something
2. **Autonomy** — I need freedom to do things my own way
3. **Relatedness** — I need to connect with other people

Schell states it's hard to overlook how well games tend to fulfil all three of these needs.

### The Overjustification effect

When a reward is attached to a task we already find intrinsically motivating, we become less interested in the task after receiving the reward <Citation id="" />.

- Extrinsic motivation (receiving a reward)
- Intrinsic motivation (because we find a task enjoyable)

![/img/overjustification-effect.png](/img/overjustification-effect.png)
Schell lists several theories that blur the lines between extrinsic, and intrinsic motivation <Citation id="" hideAuthor />.

### Immersion

Generally speaking, one of the major goals of Escape Rooms is providing an escape from reality. To be truly immersed in the world that is created and forget about everything outside <Citation id="sugar_2019_the" />.

The term _total immersion_ is often interchangeably used with the concept of _spatial presence_; a state wherein we are wholly consumed by feelings of empathy and atmosphere. Ermi and Mäyrä categorise immersion in (video) games in three different types <Citation id="nacke_2008_flow" />.

- **Sensory** — audiovisual execution
- **Imaginative** — absorption in the narrative
- **Challenge-Based** — emergent gameplay experience

At _Up the Game 2018_, Liz Cable <Citation id="" hideAuthor /> speaks about physical, emotional and intellectual immersion. Her descriptions of these types of immersion relate closely to the subdivisions established through research in video games. These subdivisions seem to translate well to the physical spaces of Escape Rooms. Furthermore, Cable's Intellectual Immersion, as well as Ermi and Mäyrä's challenge-based immersion point towards the psychological theory of Flow. Offering a cognitively demanding, though achievable, experience seems to be a major key to success in games and escape rooms alike.

### Flow

Flow is a well established concept, as introduced by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi <Citation id="" />. Flow is defined as an optimal experience; a challenging activity that requires skill. Activities that put us in a state of flow are goal-directed and bounded by rules. When this state is reached, it completely consumes what we're doing and makes time pass without us noticing. Game designers try to achieve this state of being by carefully crafting the games' flow. Creating an almost rhythmic movement moving from emotional high to low points, and vice-versa.

### Measuring the Player's Gameplay Experience

To understand what experience players desire, and how we should tailor the experience to them, we have to understand how they feel during play. There have been several attempts at measuring players' gameplay experience, while playing.

### Four Keys to Fun

Lazarro <Citation id="" hideAuthor /> has studied players' emotions before, during and after play. Through facial gestures, body language and verbal comments they identified four keys to create emotion without story cutscenes.

1. **Hard Fun** — The enjoyment of challenge and progress
2. **Easy Fun** — The enjoyment of being immersed in a game
3. **Altered States** — The enjoyment of changes in internal state
4. **People Factor** — The enjoyment of playing with others

> Players in groups emote more frequently and with more intensity than those who play on their own

> - Nicole Lazarro <Citation id="" hideAuthor />

Interestingly, the 2004 study doesn't describe any reactive system. I expect this is due to its age, and Lazarro seems to have aimed her sights on it more recently.

In her talk _Four Keys to Fun: Using Emotions to Create Engaging Design_ at AIGA Design <Citation id="" hideAuthor />, she describes how game design and human centered design relate. She explains how we as designers can react to people's emotions.

> These systems identify... they might be able to read your emotions that you're feeling and make adjustments according to that. Or you might as the user choose an emotion. I need to feel more creative, so these are the emotions I feel.
>
> - Nicole Lazarro <Citation id="" hideAuthor />

### Physiological measurement

Another of such attempts is done by Nacke & Lindley <Citation id="nacke_2008_flow" hideAuthor />, who measure the emotional state of their test subjects, while playing modified levels of Half-Life 2 (a first-person shooter). They grade the experience on two axes.

- Electromyography (EMG) to determine valence, a strong indicator of the _good_-ness of an experience.
- Galvanic Skin Response (GVR) commonly used as an indicator for arousal (how passionate we are about an experience)

Their study suggests that game levels scoring high on flow, show increased values for valence as well as arousal. Established companies, like Garmin, claim to measure stress in several of their products, based on HRV (Heart Rate Variation).

Their manual <Citation id="" /> classifies stress states ranging from 0 to 100, where:

- **0 to 25:** is a resting state
- **26 to 50:** is low stress
- **51 to 75:** is medium stress
- **76 to 100:** is high stress

Empatica offers the CE-certified E4, and lists the _EmbracePlus_ as a scientific tool. They offer real-time access to EDA, PPG, HR(V), IBI and movement through their SDK.

FitBit offers several API's to achieve similar goals, but as wel'll learn, these claims aren't as reliable as they sound.

#### What is Emotion?

To understand how people feel it's key to know how emotion works. Unfortunately, the scientific community has not seen eye-to-eye in this regard. Generally speaking there are three major lines of thinking; Basic Emotional Theory, Appraisal Theory and the Theory of Constructed Emotion. The last one of those, a fairly recent development, flips our common line of thinking about emotion on its head.

#### Variability

If Lisa Feldman Barrett is to be believed, both _physiological changes_ in our bodies and _facial expressions_ aren't a reliable way to estimate how people feel. Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett explains how emotions are not caused by physiological changes in our body. Emotions are in fact a result of the physiological changes in our body, and how our brains makes them _feel_ important to us <Citation id="" hideAuthor />.

> Your emotions are not your reactions to the world. They are your constructions or more precisely, what your bodily sensations mean in a specific context or situation that you are in.
>
> - Lisa Feldman Barrett <Citation id="" hideAuthor />

It turns out that the western idea of universal expressions of emotion are not so universal after all. While some people certainly scowl when they are angry, not everyone does. At the same time, many people who scowl are not angry.

> People move their face in very different ways during instances of the same emotion category. They also move their faces in exactly the same way in instances of different emotion categories.
>
> - Lisa Feldman Barrett <Citation id="" hideAuthor />

Assuming we display emotion using universal facial expressions suffers from the same problems as assuming everyone entering an escape room has the same level of experience. This way of thinking only takes into account a small portion of people.

![/img/universal-expression-barrett.png](/img/universal-expression-barrett.png "Myth: Universal Expressions")

To make matters worse, physiological measurements suffer from a similar problem. When an increased heart rate feels like anxiety, that is because your brains categorises it as such. They make a concept that fits with the physiological changes in your body. As a result, it's incredibly hard to 'measure emotion'. Emotions are dependant of context, and part of that context is the body we take into the room.

## Team

### Team Performance

All of this might be explained by the definition of experience. As I've argued before, experiences are not self-contained. They occur in a larger context and are highly personal. They are influenced not only by what we feel, see or hear at that time, but also the memories we take into an escape room <Citation id="" />. Since escape rooms are (generally) multi-user experiences, it's impossible to adjust the experience to fit every individual in the room. Regardless of whether we're able to sense how each individual feels. As such, it makes sense to look at the team playing a game as a whole. How do they communicate? What do they talk about, and what _don't_ they talk about?

Marlow et al. <Citation id="" hideAuthor /> conducted a meta-analysis of team communication. They argue that teams that are more familiar with each-other, communicate less frequently, but commfunication quality increased. Familiar teams share information that is less redundant, and as such communication efficiency increases. Furthermore, they determined good communication is more important to familiar teams than non-familiar teams.

> "As team familiarity increases, team members become more adept at locating expertise among team members, reducing the frequency by which team members communicate and increasing efficiency"
>
> - Marlow et al. <Citation id="" hideAuthor />

### Team Communication

- Group Flow

Better teams communicate better (?), increasing the necessity for communication in the 'more difficult' track might be a good build?
