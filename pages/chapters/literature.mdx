## Puzzle Design

Good puzzles contribute to plot, character and story development, they draw the player into the fictional world. Bad puzzles are intrusive and obstructionist <Citation id="bates_1997_designing" />.

### Fair Puzzles

As escape room designers we should have the ambition to create a fair and enjoyable puzzle, Errol Elumir argues <Citation id="" hideAuthor />. Players shouldn't have to guess what the designer thought while creating it.

### Puzzle Difficulty

By now it should be obvious that designing extremely hard puzzles shouldn't be the primary goal. However, when we do want to increase or decrease difficulty to cater to different players, there are several (metaphorical) dials to turn. In _Designing the Puzzle_, Bob Bates argues that's one of the easiest parts of puzzle design <Citation id="" />.

1. **Breadcrumbs —** Change the amount or directness of information to players
2. **Alternate solutions —** Adding alternate solutions make a puzzle easier
3. **Steps to solve —** Increasing the steps to solve a puzzle increases the difficulty
4. **Proximity —** The closer (physiologically and geographically) the solution, the easier
5. **Steering the Player —** nudging in the right direction, as a response to player actions

It's also important to be aware of some traps. Elumir thinks many escape rooms make the same errors when they try to increase difficulty <Citation id="" hideAuthor />. He describes five:

1. Identifying gates and collecting clues should be straightforward
2. It should be obvious which puzzles to work on
3. Revelatory puzzles are hard to do well, adding too many shuts out mainstream players
4. Don't add tedium to slow players down, ex. unscrewing lots of screws instead of few
5. Don't make it difficult to enter a combination

## Motivation

The first question one might ask is, why even play escape rooms in the first place? In _The Art of Game Design_ <Citation id=""/>_,_ the chapter _'The Player's Mind is Driven by the Player's Motivation'_ outlines how human motivation applies to game design. Maslow's _'A Theory of Human Motivation'_ provides an interesting lens to analyse the different activities that games offer. Schell notes that the popularity of games with online communities makes a lot of sense according to Maslow's theories.

### Self-determination theory

Beyond physical, humans have mental needs as well. According to Ryan and Deci they are:

1. **Competence** — I need to feel good at something
2. **Autonomy** — I need freedom to do things my own way
3. **Relatedness** — I need to connect with other people

Schell states it's hard to overlook how well games tend to fulfil all three of these needs.

## Elements of an Escape Room

The _2019 Escape Room Enthusiast Survey_ <Citation id="" /> has ranked the importance of several elements within escape rooms. The three factors rising to the top are:

1. Well designed puzzles and game flow
2. Novelty & Uniqueness
3. Immersion

These elements have a lot of overlap, and in this chapter we'll learn how these are interconnected and influence each-other.

## Immersion

Generally speaking, one of the major goals of Escape Rooms is providing an escape from reality. To be truly immersed in the world that is created and forget about everything outside <Citation id="sugar_2019_the" />.

The term _total immersion_ is often interchangeably used with the concept of _spatial presence_; a state wherein we are wholly consumed by feelings of empathy and atmosphere. Ermi and Mäyrä categorise immersion in (video) games in three different types <Citation id="nacke_2008_flow" />.

- **Sensory** — audiovisual execution
- **Imaginative** — absorption in the narrative
- **Challenge-Based** — emergent gameplay experience

At _Up the Game 2018_, Liz Cable <Citation id="" hideAuthor /> speaks about physical, emotional and intellectual immersion. Her descriptions of these types of immersion relate closely to the subdivisions established through research in video games. These subdivisions seem to translate well to the physical spaces of Escape Rooms. Furthermore, Cable's Intellectual Immersion, as well as Ermi and Mäyrä's challenge-based immersion point towards the psychological theory of Flow. Offering a cognitively demanding, though achievable, experience seems to be a major key to success in games and escape rooms alike.

## Flow

Flow is a well established concept, as introduced by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi <Citation id="" />. Flow is defined as an optimal experience; a challenging activity that requires skill. Activities that put us in a state of flow are goal-directed and bounded by rules. When this state is reached, it completely consumes what we're doing and makes time pass without us noticing. Game designers try to achieve this state of being by carefully crafting the games' flow. Creating an almost rhythmic movement moving from emotional high to low points, and vice-versa.

Chen <Citation id="" hideAuthor /> defines personal _Flow Zones_.

## Measuring the Player's Gameplay Experience

To understand what experience players desire, and how we should tailor the experience to them, we have to understand how they feel during play. There have been several attempts at measuring players' gameplay experience, while playing. One of such attempts is done by Nacke & Lindley <Citation id="nacke_2008_flow" hideAuthor />, who measure the emotional state of their test subjects, while playing modified levels of Half-Life 2 (a first-person shooter). They grade the experience on two axes.

- Electromyography (EMG) to determine valence, a strong indicator of the _good_-ness of an experience
- Galvanic Skin Response (GVR) commonly used as an indicator for arousal (how passionate we are about an experience)

Their study suggests that game levels scoring high on flow, show increased values for valence as well as arousal.

### Variability

However, it turns out our facial expressions and the physiological changes in our bodies aren't a reliable way to estimate how players feel. Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett explains how emotions are not caused by physiological changes in our body. Emotions are in fact a result of the physiological changes in our body, and how our brains makes them _feel_ important to us <Citation id="" hideAuthor />.

> Your emotions are not your reactions to the world. They are your constructions or more precisely, what your bodily sensations mean in a specific context or situation that you are in.

- Lisa Feldman Barrett <Citation id="" hideAuthor />

It turns out that the western idea of universal expressions of emotion are not so universal after all. While some people certainly scowl when they are angry, not everyone does. At the same time, many people who scowl are not angry.

> People move their face in very different ways during instances of the same emotion category. They also move their faces in exactly the same way in instances of different emotion categories.

- Lisa Feldman Barrett <Citation id="" hideAuthor />

Assuming we display emotion using universal facial expressions suffers from the same problems as assuming everyone entering an escape room has the same level of experience. This way of thinking only takes into account a small portion of people.

To make matters worse, physiological measurements suffer from a similar problem. When an increased heart rate feels like anxiety, that is because your brains categorises it as such. They make a concept that fits with the physiological changes in your body. As a result, it's incredibly hard to 'measure emotion'. Emotions are dependant of context, and part of that context is the body we take into the room.

## The Compulsion Loop

Nick Moran describes in his talk _Tools of Immersion_, how successfully implementing the compulsion loop leads players from one challenge to the next <Citation id="" />.

- Desire → obstacle → reward → Repeat
- Powerful loop, people are lost when they don't know what they have to do next

![/img/compulsion-loop.png](/img/compulsion-loop.png)

The compulsion loop is linked to the overjustification effect → a reward is offered so players are driven by the promise of that reward, what happens when that reward disappears?

- For many, escape rooms are intrinsically motivating, so why do we really need that structure?

## The Overjustification effect

When a reward is attached to a task we already find intrinsically motivating, we become less interested in the task after receiving the reward <Citation id="" />.

- Extrinsic motivation (receiving a reward)
- Intrinsic motivation (because we find a task enjoyable)

## Four Keys to Fun

Lazarro <Citation id="" hideAuthor /> has studied players' emotions before, during and after play. Through facial gestures, body language and verbal comments they identified four keys to create emotion without story cutscenes.

1. **Hard Fun** — The enjoyment of challenge and progress
2. **Easy Fun** — The enjoyment of being immersed in a game
3. **Altered States** — The enjoyment of changes in internal state
4. **People Factor** — The enjoyment of playing with others

![/img/4k2f.png](/img/4k2f.png "Four Keys to Fun")

Interestingly, the 2004 study doesn't describe any reactive system. I expect this is due to its age, and Lazarro seems to have aimed her sights on it more recently.

In her talk _Four Keys to Fun: Using Emotions to Create Engaging Design_ at AIGA Design <Citation id="" hideAuthor />, she describes how game design and human centered design relate. She explains how we as designers can react to people's emotions.

> These systems identify... they might be able to read your emotions that you're feeling and make adjustments according to that. Or you might as the user choose an emotion. I need to feel more creative, so these are the emotions I feel.
