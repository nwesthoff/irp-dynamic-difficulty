## Finding top escapers

We can learn some people have enjoyed escape rooms extensively, for example by examining Dutch website [Escapetalk](http://escapetalk.nl). Their platform facilitates enthusiasts to track which games they've played and to review the best rooms. Their list of _top escapers_ shows some enthusiast have played over 150 in the past 6 years, though most people will only have played a few.
