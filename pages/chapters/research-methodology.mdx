- Limitations of study
  - COVID
  - I will not go specifically into the physical limitations of swapping out puzzles/construction
  - often use examples of video game design, as they are much more visible from the outside than escape rooms
- Mention played games. 5 experiences, spread out over two days: _The End_, _The Orphanage_, _The Cooper Case_, _Flight 815_ and _Molly's Game_.
- Mention Victor being constantly embedded in the process, not a scheduled interview

## Embedded at Sherlocked

- Embedded in design team at Sherlocked.
- Frequent check-ins with Victor van Doorn, Creative Director
- Frequent check-ins with Francine Boon, Strategy & Project Lead

## Expert Panels

Throughout the project, I spoke with several experts on game design and dynamic difficulty. Most notably, I hosted two expert panels. Victor van Doorn was present during both sessions as well. Though his role was more of support and moving the conversation forward, rather than offering his insights. Since I'd be able to ask him any time I'd like.

## Finding top escapers

We can learn some people have enjoyed escape rooms extensively, for example by examining Dutch website [Escapetalk](http://escapetalk.nl). Their platform facilitates enthusiasts to track which games they've played and to review the best rooms. Their list of _top escapers_ shows some enthusiast have played over 150 in the past 6 years, though most people will only have played a few.
