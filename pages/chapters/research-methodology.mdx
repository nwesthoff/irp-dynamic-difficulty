- Limitations of study
- Why?
  - Why do we need to moderate difficulty?
- Research question incl. sub-questions
  - How do you know what people do (not) enjoy?
  - What dials can we turn to moderate difficulty?
  - How do we guage whether interactions have to be more or less difficult for a specific team?

## Goal

Ultimately I'd like to create a system that takes one or two inputs, and dynamically adjust the difficulty of a single puzzle to prototype the proposed solution.

## Approach

I have to figure out whether play speed and reaching the end in time is more important than reaching flow within the room. At a macro level we have to guide each player to play at their own pace, while still ensuring they reach the finish line. There are several factors of particular interest in solving these questions.

### Group size and dynamics

The Alchemist is an experience for 4 to 8 players. Not only do we need to consider individual players, who might have different levels of intellect and different competencies. We need to consider the group as a whole, and consider different group sizes. If technically possible, it could be interesting to provide each player with an individual score, and use that as a starting point to score the group.
