To everyone who has collaborated with me, proofread, brought me knowledge. Thank you Lise van de Ven, Zeno Kapitein, Eyal Danon, Ariel Rubin, Juliana Moreno Patel, Tommy Honton, Nick Moran, Haley ER Cooper, J Cameron Cooper, Rita Orlov, David Middleton, Jesse van der Lely and Niels Jonker.

I also want to give out my thanks for a fantastic year at Hyper Island to all my crew mates and Hyper Island staff Robert Potts, Tash Willcocks, Catherine McHenry, Kathryn Percival. As well as my Hyper Island appointed academic supervisor Cj Stockton.

Finally I would like to thank Victor van Doorn and Francine Boon from Sherlocked in particular. They have provided me with an excellent environment to work on this project. Without them, this project would not have been where it's at now.
