## Approach

I have to figure out whether play speed and reaching the end in time is more important than reaching flow within the room. At a macro level we have to guide each player to play at their own pace, while still ensuring they reach the finish line. There are several factors of particular interest in solving these questions.

### Group size and dynamics

The Alchemist is an experience for 4 to 8 players. Not only do we need to consider individual players, who might have different levels of intellect and different competencies. We need to consider the group as a whole, and consider different group sizes. If technically possible, it could be interesting to provide each player with an individual score, and use that as a starting point to score the group.

### Assessing players - input

We need to consider what our input will be. There are several ways to assess player enjoyment, as well as play speed. This will be the input for our system. We might use:

- Camera feeds
- Puzzle milestones (switches pushed, consider time and reference time)

### Puzzle difficulty

We might adjust the puzzle difficulty on the player who initializes the puzzle, or on the group as a whole.

### Room framework

This should all boil down to a framework to make the room reactive to players.

## Goal

Ultimately I'd like to create a system that takes one or two inputs, and dynamically adjust the difficulty of a single puzzle to prototype the proposed solution.

## Dynamically Adjusting Game Flow

These are some hypothetical scenarios of groups reaping the benefits of a dynamically controlled escape room.

## Enthusiasts looking for a challenge

The main complaint from enthusiasts at The Vault is a lack of challenge. Puzzles are (sometimes) a-logical, and merely an action to do. The experience of the room makes up for it, but Sherlocked wants to offer a bigger challenge to their (most loyal) customers.

## Enthusiasts having a bad day

What if a second group of enthusiasts play the new experience. They start of well but quickly realise they've taken on too much. They might get knocked down from the highest difficulty, all the way down to an easy level. This way even they get to see the finish line, though that does not ensure they escape.

## Team of colleagues, novice escape room players

On the other hand we might see a group of colleagues that know each other well, but have never played an escape room together. They might start of quite anxious, but also are deeply curious and driven to do well. They soon realize they're on a roll and might even think the puzzles start to become boring. The DDA kicks things up a notch and grows with them, they play their final puzzle(s) at the highest level.
