## Research Question

I have to figure out whether play speed and reaching the end in time is more important than reaching flow within the room. At a macro level we have to guide each player to play at their own pace, while still ensuring they reach the finish line. There are several factors of particular interest in solving these questions.

## Group size and dynamics

The Alchemist is an experience for 4 to 8 players. Not only do we need to consider individual players, who might have different levels of intellect and different competencies. We need to consider the group as a whole, and consider different group sizes. If technically possible, it could be interesting to provide each player with an individual score, and use that as a starting point to score the group.

## Assessing players - input

We need to consider what our input will be. There are several ways to assess player enjoyment, as well as play speed. This will be the input for our system. We might use:

- Camera feeds
- Puzzle milestones (switches pushed, consider time and reference time)

## Puzzle difficulty

We might adjust the puzzle difficulty on the player who initializes the puzzle, or on the group as a whole.

## Room framework

This should all boil down to a framework to make the room reactive to players. Ultimately I'd like to create a system that takes one or two inputs, and a single puzzle to

- Tech - [cogs.show](http://cogs.show)/MEKE (Mystery Environment Kontrol Engine?)

## Research Questions

- What if there's multiple experience levels within the group?

  - Do we go for the average, the slowest person?
  - Could it be possible to adjust only one of the parallel tracks?
  - Could we offer more opportunities for the business? Replay-ability?
    - Especially if we want to hide the fact that there exists a dynamic difficulty system
  - Can physiological measurements ([Nacke & Lindley](https://www.notion.so/Flow-and-Immersion-in-First-Person-Shooters-Measuring-the-player-s-gameplay-experience-ae5fbf18f43e49aa93b3fea3f620abe0)) respond quickly enough, during gameplay?

## What's been done before?

- Escape rooms

  - Escapist does some level of dynamics, but it's nothing particularly special
    [Niels Jonker](https://www.notion.so/Niels-Jonker-61d4ebfefdb443308333ef083caf2273)
  - _The Sanatorium_ at I Survived The Room NYC gives a report card for your performance
  - _The Heist_ for GuessHQ by Immersive Tech has a 'pro circuit' ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZekImmBstU))
  - Tom Knabe
    > I generally try to stick it to one or two puzzles which I call “governors” that increase or decrease difficulty to buy or lose time getting teams to the final scene before the game ends
  - Eyal Danon describes what [COGS](http://cogs.show) does based on time or determined by GM:
    > If at one point a drawer opens giving the players a clue for the next puzzle, if it's too early in the game the drawer next to it opens with tougher clues, or leading them down a tougher path
  - Lab13 has adaptive difficulty
  - Gascape has 'expert mode' - multiple levels of difficulty, but you pick before playing

- In games:
  - Resident Evil 4 — dynamic play difficulty (opaque):
    [What Capcom didn't tell you about Resident Evil 4](https://www.notion.so/What-Capcom-didn-t-tell-you-about-Resident-Evil-4-83cefce077be466d870754d19d177c5b)
  - Metal Gear Solid 5: Phantom Pain — enemies respond to repetitive tactics
  - Half Life 2 - more health packs when you're almost dying
  - Uncharted 4 - while technically not dynamic difficulty, it is interesting: when climbing multiple towers, the first puzzle is always the easiest, regardless of which one is found first. So the flow is always going up.
