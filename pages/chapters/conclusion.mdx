To conclude, I will summarise my findings and answer my primary research question.

<Callout title="Research Question" emoji="ðŸ¤”">

How might we offer an escape room that challenges enthusiasts without alienating novices?

</Callout>

Some of the recommendations I make in this conclusion apply to the inputs (metrics) and outputs (resulting adaptation), while I will also provide some that apply on a meta level (goal of the system).

## Input

Most escape rooms, and especially the ones doing dynamic difficulty, determine puzzle difficulty by duration. While you might say time is a reliable indicator for performance, this does not directly mean players have an enjoyable experience. Time moderation can do an excellent job at selectively picking which puzzles are skipped when a team is slower instead of cutting off the end. This means it's possible to have players experience the entire story (though less rich), instead of leaving them at a cliffhanger.

Time doesn't say anything about the perceived difficulty of a puzzle or escape room. It could very well be that a team finishes a game within 36 minutes. However, if those were the best 36 minutes of their life, that could very well be worth it. The idea that they could have had 60 minutes of that same high-quality experience with a perfectly matched difficulty might start compelling now. I propose escape room designers look at three different metrics than time to gauge a perfect challenge. These can be combined with time as a metric to (theoretically) create a perfect difficulty game, while simultaneously giving everyone an equal amount of play time.

### Engagement & Frustration

Recognise when players are bored or don't know what to do. When they become disengaged, they will sit around, start breaking things and they are usually physically distanced from the puzzle to solve. Frustration is generally recognised by groups making lots of mistakes. Is the group guessing or are they still interested in learning how to solve the puzzle?

</div>

<div>

### Momentum

Consider whether a group is picking up speed. Rather than looking at time, look at the accelleration of their performance. Measure whether they are solving puzzles faster than earlier on in the game.

</div>

<div>

### Team Communication

Instead of looking at individuals through physiological data, we might do some analysis on the performance of a team. Sawyer and Marlow have shown teams that know each other well communicate less often, but to more effect. They know _who_ to ask for which type of puzzle.

## Output

In terms of output, the change that should be done to current gameplay there are several suggestions to consider as well. Firstly, it's important to restate that unfair puzzles and unfair escape rooms can't be fixed simply by dialling down difficulty. When you consistently frustrate players, whatever their skill level, that may be due to the presence of a logic hole. This creates unfair puzzles, and unfair puzzles require specific interventions. For example, if you know something as a designer that players don't, the puzzle won't be solved by reducing the steps to solve, you have to share that information.

When directing players, attempt doing so with gentle nudges first. The output of a dynamic difficulty system should be subtle. Like changing lights to signal important items and directing music to a specific part of the room. When puzzles shouldn't be played, it should not be too obvious they exist only for faster players.

It's impossible to adjust the experience to fit every individual in the room. Especially when there is a large spread of skill levels within the team. Regardless of whether we're able to sense how each individual feels, it's a complicated endeavour to .

As a stretch goal, escape room designers could adapt beyond difficulty. They could adapt gameplay based on specific skills or preferences. For example, familiar teams communicate better. By increasing interdependence for these teams, we ask them to rely more on each other compared to other teams. Another example could be teams that are very familiar with escape games individually, but without experience playing together (they're unfamiliar as a team). Teams like these are likely less adept at communicating effectively, but the individuals are skilful since they have seen lots of escape game puzzles before. Instead, we could split them up a little more than usual to work on puzzles individually or in duos.

Difficulty of the unfamiliar, as Nick Moran calls it, is difficult to moderate. The players' ability to overcome obstacles like these is primarily a function of prior experience. By breaking the mould, we can craft obstacles that are relatively hard for an enthusiast, compared to the novice, since everything is new to the latter. Creating unfamiliar puzzles is easier said than done however. Actually, the increasing amount of escape rooms likely means it's harder and harder to come up with interactions that are new to enthusiasts. The result is that it's increasingly difficult to offer novices and enthusiasts the same challenge with a single puzzle variant. Which makes the argument in favour of dynamic difficulty stronger.

## Meta-level

Most highly rated games are highly linear, but that doesn't mean there is no room for games that offer a challenge. Because I also learned some enthusiasts do like solving challenging puzzles.

Based on my research and experiences, I think many games can thrive without difficulty, and games do get rated poorly when they are too hard and especially when they're unfair. It's a risky endeavour to make challenging escape rooms, because challenge and fairness are hard to balance. Moreover, challenge-based immersion requires that players get the _exact_ difficulty that matches a team's abilities to get an optimum experience. The required challenge is influenced by their varying abilities, which depends on a group's familiarity too. However, I've also learnt that designers can get away with _a lot._ Like the skip button in _Push the Button_. So long as they fit it in the narrative, and players never get the idea that the puzzle or escape room is unfair. These decisions may offer a better experience than not implementing them, even if they would be potentially game-breaking when they don't fit the theme and narrative.

One might also argue that escape rooms already are somewhat dynamic. Games become fair through a robust clueing network, but difficulty can be lowered by correctly timed (and subtle) hints. If you can't be subtle about dynamic difficulty, you could try to make it part of the narrative. Explain _why_ the difficulty is not the same for every group.

Dynamic difficulty should always start easy, just like a regular game. At the start it's hard to gauge a team's speed, or their wishes for difficulty. And when players disengage early on in a game, it's hard to get them to trust the designer again. Employ a bell curve to scale difficulty, but make its steepness and peak depend on the team's abilities.

Finally, escape game designers also aim to create consistent experiences, so players of any level can talk about their experience without major disconnects. They want the medium to be as consistent as movies, but they could be as flexible as video games. I think moving forward, escape room designers have to embrace the medium as its own thing. To be as flexible as video games while being more immersive (on all categories) than video games and movies will ever be.

These levers are small wins, but combining those can potentially influence the experience with a fine-grained control not previously seen in escape rooms.

## Dynamic Difficulty Framework

### Scenarios

These are some hypothetical scenarios of groups reaping the benefits of a dynamically controlled escape room.

### Enthusiasts looking for a challenge

The main complaint from enthusiasts at The Vault is a lack of challenge. Puzzles are (sometimes) a-logical, and merely an action to do. The experience of the room makes up for it, but Sherlocked wants to offer a bigger challenge to their (most loyal) customers.

</div>

<div>

### Enthusiasts having a bad day

What if a second group of enthusiasts play the new experience. They start of well but quickly realise they've taken on too much. They might get knocked down from the highest difficulty, all the way down to an easy level. This way even they get to see the finish line, though that does not ensure they escape.

</div>

<div>

### Team of colleagues, novice escape room players

On the other hand we might see a group of colleagues that know each other well, but have never played an escape room together. They might start of quite anxious, but also are deeply curious and driven to do well. They soon realize they're on a roll and might even think the puzzles start to become boring. The DDA kicks things up a notch and grows with them, they play their final puzzle(s) at the highest level.

Many game designers see dynamic difficulty as an issue with the game. The game designers I've spoken with see it as an error in game design when too many teams need a hint. Instead I see that differently, dynamic difficulty could take the ideas of hints to the extreme. Like in _The Gallery_ where some groups would actually like to figure out the mastermind, other groups will only do the physical action of doing what the puzzle says. This isn't welcomed in the industry, at least currently. But I believe this might change when it dynamic difficulty has been done well to improve the experience, instead of being detrimental. As such, my final conclusion of this report is as follows:

<Callout title="Conclusion">

The goal of dynamic difficulty is to control the experience based on play speed as well as perceived difficulty. To keep teams in a flow state while being aware this influences the time it takes groups to escape. The goal is to intellectually and physically challenge the group throughout the experience. _And_ to make teams escape with minutes to spare, during which they **perform at the highest of their abilities regardless of their skill level**. This positively affects overall **increased immersion**, as a result of challenge-based immersion.

## The Podcast

As part of this research I hosted a panel, which was recorded in its entirety. I personally thought it was an eye-opening conversation, and would recommend listening to it if my report was interesting. Especially if you enjoyed the audio quotes in the previous chapter.

## Further research

As recommendations for further research I'd suggest an in-depth look at practical tools for real-time measurement of team performance and group flow.

Another area of interest could be statistical analysis into the psychological need of escaping (as opposed to failing escape). Whether players review games they escape from more favourably than games they do not. Are the games they don't escape from perceived as so difficult they perceived as unfair? Does it matter how much of the game they did play. Concretely, does it matter if around 20% of the experience is left or 60% is left?

Furthermore, I've realised some enthusiasts care about setting records, though many I spoke with do not. Since dynamic difficulty would create an unfair record when players do not play the same game, I suggest statistical analysis on the desire for setting time records. Also consider whether they find that _more_ important than playing an escape room that matches their abilities?

My final and (I think) most promising and concrete recommendation is to do an analysis of team dynamics applied to escape games. What are the characteristics of a team that is fast? What do teams look like that rate the experience highest? Team characteristics could regard personality types, group relation (colleagues, family etc.) or communication styles.

## Reflective Statement

During this project I became most excited after I had read something or talked to someone. Gaining new knowledge allowed me to make new connections between what I had just learnt, and what knowledge I had recorded before, which was very exciting. During the middle part I got very stuck. There was a phase of 'this doesn't work', and I had a lot of trouble getting out of that feeling. At some point, something clicked, and I realised _why_ escape rooms are special. That helped me get out of it, but I think I was mostly feeling better because external factors were less of an issue.

While writing in the final weeks I had trouble focusing on finishing a section of text. I kept kept jumping around in my files, and left many sentences unfinished because I had just thought of something that just _had_ to go somewhere else. Because of that I fully fleshing out pieces of knowledge. To allow myself to elaborate on a piece of knowledge, because I kept reminding myself of interconnected parts.

My solution was to tell Francine what I'd be writing that day, which acted as a social check. I copied that small section into a different text editor, in order to dedicate myself to that task, and that task only. Finally, I set a Pomodoro timer, so I knew not to check my phone and dedicate that time to one task only. This worked very well for me and helped me elaborate on previously surface-level paragraphs of knowledge.

One of the best experiences I've had during my education was hosting the panels with escape room legends. And that says a lot, because Hyper Island has had some incredible industry leaders and guest-speakers as well.

Even though I've enjoyed my work with Sherlocked _a lot_, and appreciate the fantastic environment they have offered me to take a stab at this problem. I have decided to get a job elsewhere. I think much of what I've learnt during this project is applicable throughout the field of experience design. And I have a positive outlook that I'll be able to translate what I've learnt in a different domain, like Nicole Lazarro has done. Transposing her work to the field of user experience design as a whole, as she's demonstrated with her talk at AIGA Conference. I'm excited as much as I'm relieved to finally put this work out into the world.
