# How might we offer an escape room that challenges enthusiasts without alienating novices?

## Team Performance

It's impossible to adjust the experience to fit every individual in the room. Regardless of whether we're able to sense how each individual feels. As such,

Better teams communicate better (?), increasing the necessity for communication in the 'more difficult' track might be a good build?

# Dynamically Adjusting Game Flow

These are some hypothetical scenarios of groups reaping the benefits of a dynamically controlled escape room.

### Enthusiasts looking for a challenge

The main complaint from enthusiasts at The Vault is a lack of challenge. Puzzles are (sometimes) a-logical, and merely an action to do. The experience of the room makes up for it, but Sherlocked wants to offer a bigger challenge to their (most loyal) customers.

### Enthusiasts having a bad day

What if a second group of enthusiasts play the new experience. They start of well but quickly realise they've taken on too much. They might get knocked down from the highest difficulty, all the way down to an easy level. This way even they get to see the finish line, though that does not ensure they escape.

### Team of colleagues, novice escape room players

On the other hand we might see a group of colleagues that know each other well, but have never played an escape room together. They might start of quite anxious, but also are deeply curious and driven to do well. They soon realize they're on a roll and might even think the puzzles start to become boring. The DDA kicks things up a notch and grows with them, they play their final puzzle(s) at the highest level.

## Conclusions

There is an argument to be made that the compulsion loop should be reconsidered. The compulsion loop suggests that players are only to solve an escape room because of a reward, which isn't unequivocally true. For many, the experience of playing escape rooms is motivated by their appeal as a medium, not that they offer the reward of escaping.

- Essentially, escape rooms already are somewhat dynamic. Games become fair through a robust clueing network. Difficulty is lowered by correctly timed hints (often when the player asks for them).
- Many game designers see dynamic difficulty as an issue with the game. When too many teams need a hint, most game designers see that as an error in game design. Dynamic difficulty would take those those ideas to the extreme, which (at least currently) isn't welcomed in the industry. This might be a case of 'I have to see it to believe it' though.
- Designers can get away with _a lot_, so long as they fit it in the narrative, and so long as they never give the idea that it is unfair (unbeatable).
- Highly rated games becoming more linear, doesn't mean there is no room for games that offer a challenge (I mean, look at Dark Souls). I think many games can thrive without difficulty, and games do get rated poorly when they are too hard and especially when they're unfair. In that regard it might seem risky to make escape rooms hard, because it's difficult to distinguish difficulty from fairness without rigorous play testing.
- Game designers want to create consistent experiences, so players of any level can talk about their experience without major disconnects. They want to be as consistent as movies, but they could be as flexible as video games. I think moving forward, escape room designers have to embrace the medium as its own thing. To be as flexible as video games while being more immersive (on all types) than video games and movies will ever be.
- When players disengage early on in a game, it's hard to get them back. A drawback of _The Witness'_ puzzle language is that they _require_ players to learn how they work. When a puzzle is brute forced, they don't learn its language, and won't be able to solve later puzzles
- It's impossible to adjust the experience to fit every individual in the room. Regardless of whether we're able to sense how each individual feels.

## Further research

- measuring teams
- standardised 'difficulty levels'/kijkwijzer for the industry
- An analysis what the characteristics are of a team that does well

## Reflective Statement

- every time I read something I got really excited to write stuff down, make connections between sections
- the middle part was a deep rut. Stuck in the 'this doesn't work', but couldn't unstuck myself from that. realisation that escape rooms are special in three key ways (time-constraint, team-based and that they happen in a physical space), got me un-stuck.
- Actually writing I was too focused on making connections, had a hard time actually working on a section and kept jumping around in my files.

  - Had trouble finishing each section and wasn't able to elaborate on a section, because I kept seeing links between all the interconnected parts. As a result everything is still at surface-level, even though I knew much deeper stuff.
  - I started to tell Francine what I'd be writing that day (social check). I copied that small section into a different text editor (dedicate task), and set a Pomodoro timer (dedicate time).
  - Copied that section back after I finished it, was also much easier for proofreading. I could tell Francine exactly which parts I had changed.

- Hosting a panel with escape room legends has been one of the best experiences I've had during my education. That says a lot, because Hyper Island has linked us with some incredible companies and speakers as well.
- Even though I've enjoyed my work with Sherlocked **a lot**, and appreciate the fantastic environment they have given me to take a stab at this problem. I have decided to get a job elsewhere. I think much of what I've learnt during this project is applicable throughout the field of experience design. And I have a positive outlook that I'll be able to translate what I've learnt in a different domain, like Nicole Lazarro has done. Transposing her work to the field of user experience design as a whole, as she's demonstrated with her talk at AIGA Conference.
- I'm excited as much as I'm relieved to finally put this work out into the world.
