## Theory of Flow

These are some hypothetical scenarios of groups reaping the benefits of a dynamically controlled escape room.

## Enthusiasts looking for a challenge

The main complaint from enthusiasts at The Vault is a lack of challenge. Puzzles are (sometimes) a-logical, and merely an action to do. The experience of the room makes up for it, but Sherlocked wants to offer a bigger challenge to their (most loyal) customers.

## Enthusiasts having a bad day

What if a second group of enthusiasts play the new experience. They start of well but quickly realise they've taken on too much. They might get knocked down from the highest difficulty, all the way down to an easy level. This way even they get to see the finish line, though that does not ensure they escape.

## Team of colleagues, novice escape room players

On the other hand we might see a group of colleagues that know each other well, but have never played an escape room together. They might start of quite anxious, but also are deeply curious and driven to do well. They soon realize they're on a roll and might even think the puzzles start to become boring. The DDA kicks things up a notch and grows with them, they play their final puzzle(s) at the highest level.

## The Compulsion Loop

- Desire → obstacle → reward → Repeat
- Powerful loop, people are lost when they **don't** \*\*know what they have to do next

- The compulsion loop is linked to the overjustification effect → a reward is offered so players are driven by the promise of that reward, what happens when that reward disappears?
  - For many, escape rooms are intrinsically motivating, so why do we really need that structure?

## The Overjustification effect

- When a reward is attached to a task we already find intrinsically motivating, we become less interested in the task after receiving the reward
  - Extrinsic motivation (receiving a reward)
  - Intrinsic motivation (because we find a task enjoyable)
