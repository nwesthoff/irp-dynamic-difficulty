## Theory of Flow

Flow is a well established concept in psychology introduced by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi <Citation id="" />. Flow is defined as an optimal experience; a challenging activity that requires skill. Activities that put us in a state of flow are goal-directed and bounded by rules. When this state is reached, it completely consumes what we're doing and makes time pass without us noticing. Game designers try to achieve this state of being by carefully crafting the games' flow. Creating an almost rhythmic movement moving from emotional high to low points, and vice-versa.

## The Compulsion Loop

Nick Moran describes in his talk _Tools of Immersion_, how successfully implementing the compulsion loop leads players from one challenge to the next <Citation id="" />.

- Desire → obstacle → reward → Repeat
- Powerful loop, people are lost when they **don't** know what they have to do next

The compulsion loop is linked to the overjustification effect → a reward is offered so players are driven by the promise of that reward, what happens when that reward disappears?

- For many, escape rooms are intrinsically motivating, so why do we really need that structure?

## The Overjustification effect

When a reward is attached to a task we already find intrinsically motivating, we become less interested in the task after receiving the reward <Citation id="" />.

- Extrinsic motivation (receiving a reward)
- Intrinsic motivation (because we find a task enjoyable)

## Measuring the Player's Gameplay Experience

There have been several attempts at measuring players' gameplay experience, while playing. One of such attempts is done by Nacke & Lindley (<Citation id="nacke_2008_flow">2008</Citation>), who measure the emotional state of their test subjects, while playing modified levels of Half-Life 2 (a first-person shooter). They grade the experience on two axes.

- Electromyography (EMG) to determine valence, a strong indicator of the _good_-ness of an experience
- Galvanic Skin Response (GVR) commonly used as an indicator for arousal (how passionate we are about an experience)

Their study suggests that game levels scoring high on flow, show increased values for valence as well as arousal.
